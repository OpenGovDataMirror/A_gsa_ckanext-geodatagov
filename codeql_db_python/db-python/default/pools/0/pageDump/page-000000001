Decimal floating point has finite precision with arbitrarily large bounds.

The purpose of this module is to support arithmetic using familiar
"schoolhouse" rules and to avoid some of the tricky representation
issues associated with binary floating point.  The package is especially
useful for financial applications or for contexts where users have
expectations that are at odds with binary floating point (for instance,
in binary floating point, 1.00 % 0.1 gives 0.09999999999999995 instead
of 0.0; Decimal('1.00') % Decimal('0.1') returns the expected
Decimal('0.00')).

    'b'Numerical overflow.

    This occurs and signals overflow if the adjusted exponent of a result
    (from a conversion or from an operation that is not an attempt to divide
    by zero), after rounding, would be greater than the largest value that
    can be handled by the implementation (the value Emax).

    The result depends on the rounding mode:

    For round-half-up and round-half-even (and for round-half-down and
    round-up, if implemented), the result of the operation is [sign,inf],
    where sign is the sign of the intermediate result.  For round-down, the
    result is the largest finite number that can be represented in the
    current precision, with the sign of the intermediate result.  For
    round-ceiling, the result is the same as for round-down if the sign of
    the intermediate result is 1, or is [0,inf] otherwise.  For round-floor,
    the result is the same as for round-down if the sign of the intermediate
    result is 0, or is [1,inf] otherwise.  In all cases, Inexact and Rounded
    will also be raised.

    'b'9'u'9'b'Numerical underflow with result rounded to 0.

    This occurs and signals underflow if a result is inexact and the
    adjusted exponent of the result would be smaller (more negative) than
    the smallest value that can be handled by the implementation (the value
    Emin).  That is, the result is both inexact and subnormal.

    The result after an underflow will be a subnormal number rounded, if
    necessary, so that its exponent is not less than Etiny.  This may result
    in 0 with the sign of the intermediate result and an exponent of Etiny.

    In all cases, Inexact, Rounded, and Subnormal will also be raised.

        'u'multiply multiplies two operands.

        If either operand is a special value then the general rules apply.
        Otherwise, the operands are multiplied together
        ('long multiplication'), resulting in a number which may be as long as
        the sum of the lengths of the two operands.

        operand.  It may be rounded using the current rounding setting (if the
        exponent is being increased), multiplied by a positive power of ten (if
        the exponent is being decreased), or is unchanged (if the exponent is
        already equal to that of the right-hand operand).

        Unlike other operations, if the length of the coefficient after the
        quantize operation would be greater than precision then an Invalid
        operation condition is raised.  This guarantees that, unless there is
        an error condition, the exponent of the result of a quantize is always
        equal to that of the right-hand operand.

        Also unlike other operations, quantize will never raise Underflow, even
        if the result is subnormal and inexact.

    spec is a dictionary whose keys should include 'thousands_sep' and
    'grouping'; typically it's the result of parsing the format
    specifier using _parse_format_specifier.

    The min_width keyword argument gives the minimum length of the
    result, which will be padded on the left with zeros if necessary.

    If necessary, the zero padding adds an extra '0' on the left to
    avoid a leading thousands separator.  For example, inserting
    commas every three digits in '123456', with min_width=8, gives
    '0,123,456', even though that has length 9.

Functions:

alarm() -- cause SIGALRM after a specified time [Unix only]
setitimer() -- cause a signal (described below) after a specified
               float time and the timer may restart then [Unix only]
getitimer() -- get current value of timer [Unix only]
signal() -- set the action for a given signal
getsignal() -- get the signal action for a given signal
pause() -- wait until a signal arrives [Unix only]
default_int_handler() -- default SIGINT handler

signal constants:
SIG_DFL -- used to refer to the system default handler
SIG_IGN -- used to ignore the signal
NSIG -- number of defined signals
SIGINT, SIGTERM, etc. -- signal numbers

itimer constants:
ITIMER_REAL -- decrements in real time, and delivers SIGALRM upon
               expiration
ITIMER_VIRTUAL -- decrements only when the process is executing,
               and delivers SIGVTALRM upon expiration
ITIMER_PROF -- decrements both when the process is executing and
               when the system is executing on behalf of the process.
               Coupled with ITIMER_VIRTUAL, this timer is usually
               used to profile the time spent by the application
               in user and kernel space. SIGPROF is delivered upon
               expiration.

socket(family=-1, type=-1, proto=-1, fileno=None) -> socket object

Open a socket of the given type.  The family argument specifies the
address family; it defaults to AF_INET.  The type argument specifies
whether this is a stream (SOCK_STREAM, this is the default)
or datagram (SOCK_DGRAM) socket.  The protocol argument defaults to 0,
specifying the default protocol.  Keyword arguments are accepted.
The socket is created as non-inheritable.

When a fileno is passed in, family, type and proto are auto-detected,
unless they are explicitly set.

A socket object represents one endpoint of a network connection.

'_statu'string helper module'formatter_field_name_splitformatter_parser_stringu'Create a compiled struct object.

Return a new Struct object which writes and reads binary data according to
the format string.

See help(struct) for more on format strings.'u'struct format string'u'Struct.format'iter_unpackpackpack_intou'struct size in bytes'u'Struct.size'unpackunpack_fromStructu'Functions to convert between Python values and C structs.
Python bytes objects are used to hold the data representing the C struct
and also as format strings (explained below) to describe the layout of data
in the C struct.

The optional first format char indicates byte order, size and alignment:
  @: native order, size & alignment (default)
  =: native order, std. size & alignment
  <: little-endian, std. size & alignment
  >: big-endian, std. size & alignment
  !: same as >

The remaining chars indicate types of args and must match exactly;
these can be preceded by a decimal repeat count:
  x: pad byte (no data); c:char; b:signed byte; B:unsigned byte;
  ?: _Bool (requires C99; if not available, char is used instead)
  h:short; H:unsigned short; i:int; I:unsigned int;
  l:long; L:unsigned long; f:float; d:double; e:half-float.
Special cases (preceding decimal count indicates length):
  s:string (array of char); p: pascal string (with count byte).
Special cases (only available in native format):
  n:ssize_t; N:size_t;
  P:an integer type that is wide enough to hold a pointer.
Special case (not in native mode unless 'long long' in platform C):
  q:long long; Q:unsigned long long
Whitespace between formats is ignored.

The variable struct.error is an exception raised on errors.

(Note that this module provides a Python version of the threading.local
 class.  Depending on the version of Python you're using, there may be a
 faster one available.  You should always import the `local` class from
 `threading`.)

Thread-local objects support the management of thread-local data.
If you have data that you want to be local to a thread, simply create
a thread-local object and use its attributes:

  >>> mydata = local()
  >>> mydata.number = 42
  >>> mydata.number
  42

You can also access the local-object's dictionary:

  >>> mydata.__dict__
  {'number': 42}
  >>> mydata.__dict__.setdefault('widgets', [])
  []
  >>> mydata.widgets
  []

What's important about thread-local objects is that their data are
local to a thread. If we access the data in a different thread:

  >>> log = []
  >>> def f():
  ...     items = sorted(mydata.__dict__.items())
  ...     log.append(items)
  ...     mydata.number = 11
  ...     log.append(mydata.number)

  >>> import threading
  >>> thread = threading.Thread(target=f)
  >>> thread.start()
  >>> thread.join()
  >>> log
  [[], 11]

we get different data.  Furthermore, changes made in the other thread
don't affect data seen in this thread:

  >>> mydata.number
  42

Of course, values you get from a local object, including a __dict__
attribute, are for whatever thread was current at the time the
attribute was read.  For that reason, you generally don't want to save
these values across threads, as they apply only to the thread they
came from.

You can create custom local objects by subclassing the local class:

  >>> class MyLocal(local):
  ...     number = 2
  ...     def __init__(self, /, **kw):
  ...         self.__dict__.update(kw)
  ...     def squared(self):
  ...         return self.number ** 2

This can be useful to support default values, methods and
initialization.  Note that if you define an __init__ method, it will be
called each time the local object is used in a separate thread.  This
is necessary to initialize each thread's dictionary.

Now if we create a local object:

  >>> mydata = MyLocal(color='red')

Now we have a default number:

  >>> mydata.number
  2

an initial color:

  >>> mydata.color
  'red'
  >>> del mydata.color

And a method that operates on the data:

  >>> mydata.squared()
  4

As before, we can access the data in a separate thread:

  >>> log = []
  >>> thread = threading.Thread(target=f)
  >>> thread.start()
  >>> thread.join()
  >>> log
  [[('color', 'red')], 11]

without affecting this thread's data:

  >>> mydata.number
  2
  >>> mydata.color
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  AttributeError: 'MyLocal' object has no attribute 'color'

Note that subclasses can define slots, but they are not thread
local. They are shared across threads:

  >>> class MyLocal(local):
  ...     __slots__ = 'number'

  >>> mydata = MyLocal()
  >>> mydata.number = 42
  >>> mydata.color = 'red'

So, the separate thread:

  >>> thread = threading.Thread(target=f)
  >>> thread.start()
  >>> thread.join()

        Cleans up adapter specific items.HTTPAdapterThe built-in HTTP Adapter for urllib3.

    Provides a general-case interface for Requests sessions to contact HTTP and
    HTTPS urls by implementing the Transport Adapter interface. This class will
    usually be created by the :class:`Session <Session>` class under the
    covers.

    :param pool_connections: The number of urllib3 connection pools to cache.
    :param pool_maxsize: The maximum number of connections to save in the pool.
    :param max_retries: The maximum number of retries each connection
        should attempt. Note, this applies only to failed DNS lookups, socket
        connections and connection timeouts, never to requests where data has
        made it to the server. By default, Requests does not retry failed
        connections. If you need granular control over the conditions under

    Given a raw bytes sequence, return the best possibles charset usable to render str objects.
    If there is no results, it is a strong indicator that the source is binary/not text.
    By default, the process will extract 5 blocs of 512o each to assess the mess and coherence of a given sequence.
    And will give up a particular code page after 20% of measured mess. Those criteria are customizable at will.

    The preemptive behavior DOES NOT replace the traditional detection workflow, it prioritize a particular code page
    but never take it for granted. Can improve the performance.

    You may want to focus your attention to some code page or/and not others, use cp_isolation and cp_exclusion for that
    purpose.

    This function will strip the SIG in the payload/sequence every time except on UTF-16, UTF-32.
    By default the library does not setup any handler other than the NullHandler, if you choose to set the 'explain'
    toggle to True it will alter the logger configuration to add a StreamHandler that is suitable for debugging.
    Custom logging format and handler can be set manually.

    Given a raw bytes sequence, return the best possibles charset usable to render str objects.
    If there is no results, it is a strong indicator that the source is binary/not text.
    By default, the process will extract 5 blocs of 512o each to assess the mess and coherence of a given sequence.
    And will give up a particular code page after 20% of measured mess. Those criteria are customizable at will.

    The preemptive behavior DOES NOT replace the traditional detection workflow, it prioritize a particular code page
    but never take it for granted. Can improve the performance.

    You may want to focus your attention to some code page or/and not others, use cp_isolation and cp_exclusion for that
    purpose.

    This function will strip the SIG in the payload/sequence every time except on UTF-16, UTF-32.
    By default the library does not setup any handler other than the NullHandler, if you choose to set the 'explain'
    toggle to True it will alter the logger configuration to add a StreamHandler that is suitable for debugging.
    Custom logging format and handler can be set manually.

This module is an optparse-inspired command-line parsing library that:

    - handles both optional and positional arguments
    - produces highly informative usage messages
    - supports parsers that dispatch to sub-parsers

The following is a simple usage example that sums integers from the
command-line and writes the result to a file::

    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(
        description='sum the integers at the command line')
    parser.add_argument(
        'integers', metavar='int', nargs='+', type=int,
        help='an integer to be summed')
    parser.add_argument(
        '--log', default=sys.stdout, type=argparse.FileType('w'),
        help='the file where the sum should be written')
    args = parser.parse_args()
    args.log.write('%s' % sum(args.integers))
    args.log.close()

The module contains the following public classes:

    - ArgumentParser -- The main entry point for command-line parsing. As the
        example above shows, the add_argument() method is used to populate
        the parser with actions for optional and positional arguments. Then
        the parse_args() method is invoked to convert the args at the
        command-line into an object with attributes.

    - ArgumentError -- The exception raised by ArgumentParser objects when
        there are errors with the parser's actions. Errors raised while
        parsing the command-line are caught by ArgumentParser and emitted
        as command-line messages.

    - FileType -- A factory for defining types of files to be created. As the
        example above shows, instances of FileType are typically passed as
        the type= argument of add_argument() calls.

    - Action -- The base class for parser actions. Typically actions are
        selected by passing strings like 'store_true' or 'append_const' to
        the action= argument of add_argument(). However, for greater
        customization of ArgumentParser actions, subclasses of Action may
        be defined and passed as the action= argument.

    - HelpFormatter, RawDescriptionHelpFormatter, RawTextHelpFormatter,
        ArgumentDefaultsHelpFormatter -- Formatter classes which
        may be passed as the formatter_class= argument to the
        ArgumentParser constructor. HelpFormatter is the default,
        RawDescriptionHelpFormatter and RawTextHelpFormatter tell the parser
        not to change the formatting for help text, and
        ArgumentDefaultsHelpFormatter adds information about argument defaults
        to the help.

All other classes in this module are considered implementation details.
(Also note that HelpFormatter and RawDescriptionHelpFormatter are only
considered public as object names -- the API of the formatter objects is
still considered an implementation detail.)

    Action objects are used by an ArgumentParser to represent the information
    needed to parse a single argument from one or more strings from the
    command line. The keyword arguments to the Action constructor are also
    all attributes of Action instances.

    Keyword Arguments:

        - option_strings -- A list of command-line option strings which
            should be associated with this action.

        - dest -- The name of the attribute to hold the created object(s)

        - nargs -- The number of command-line arguments that should be
            consumed. By default, one argument will be consumed and a single
            value will be produced.  Other values include:
                - N (an integer) consumes N arguments (and produces a list)
                - '?' consumes zero or one arguments
                - '*' consumes zero or more arguments (and produces a list)
                - '+' consumes one or more arguments (and produces a list)
            Note that the difference between the default and nargs=1 is that
            with the default, a single value will be produced, while with
            nargs=1, a list containing a single value will be produced.

        - const -- The value to be produced if the option is specified and the
            option uses an action that takes no values.

        - default -- The value to be produced if the option is not specified.

        - type -- A callable that accepts a single string argument, and
            returns the converted value.  The standard Python types str, int,
            float, and complex are useful examples of such callables.  If None,
            str is used.

        - choices -- A container of values that should be allowed. If not None,
            after a command-line argument has been converted to the appropriate
            type, an exception will be raised if it is not a member of this
            collection.

        - required -- True if the action must always be specified at the
            command line. This is only meaningful for optional command-line
            arguments.

        - help -- The help string describing the argument.

        - metavar -- The name to be used for the option's argument with the
            help string. If None, the 'dest' value will be used as the name.

This module is an optparse-inspired command-line parsing library that:

    - handles both optional and positional arguments
    - produces highly informative usage messages
    - supports parsers that dispatch to sub-parsers

The following is a simple usage example that sums integers from the
command-line and writes the result to a file::

    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(
        description='sum the integers at the command line')
    parser.add_argument(
        'integers', metavar='int', nargs='+', type=int,
        help='an integer to be summed')
    parser.add_argument(
        '--log', default=sys.stdout, type=argparse.FileType('w'),
        help='the file where the sum should be written')
    args = parser.parse_args()
    args.log.write('%s' % sum(args.integers))
    args.log.close()

The module contains the following public classes:

    - ArgumentParser -- The main entry point for command-line parsing. As the
        example above shows, the add_argument() method is used to populate
        the parser with actions for optional and positional arguments. Then
        the parse_args() method is invoked to convert the args at the
        command-line into an object with attributes.

    - ArgumentError -- The exception raised by ArgumentParser objects when
        there are errors with the parser's actions. Errors raised while
        parsing the command-line are caught by ArgumentParser and emitted
        as command-line messages.

    - FileType -- A factory for defining types of files to be created. As the
        example above shows, instances of FileType are typically passed as
        the type= argument of add_argument() calls.

    - Action -- The base class for parser actions. Typically actions are
        selected by passing strings like 'store_true' or 'append_const' to
        the action= argument of add_argument(). However, for greater
        customization of ArgumentParser actions, subclasses of Action may
        be defined and passed as the action= argument.

    - HelpFormatter, RawDescriptionHelpFormatter, RawTextHelpFormatter,
        ArgumentDefaultsHelpFormatter -- Formatter classes which
        may be passed as the formatter_class= argument to the
        ArgumentParser constructor. HelpFormatter is the default,
        RawDescriptionHelpFormatter and RawTextHelpFormatter tell the parser
        not to change the formatting for help text, and
        ArgumentDefaultsHelpFormatter adds information about argument defaults
        to the help.

All other classes in this module are considered implementation details.
(Also note that HelpFormatter and RawDescriptionHelpFormatter are only
considered public as object names -- the API of the formatter objects is
still considered an implementation detail.)

    Action objects are used by an ArgumentParser to represent the information
    needed to parse a single argument from one or more strings from the
    command line. The keyword arguments to the Action constructor are also
    all attributes of Action instances.

    Keyword Arguments:

        - option_strings -- A list of command-line option strings which
            should be associated with this action.

        - dest -- The name of the attribute to hold the created object(s)

        - nargs -- The number of command-line arguments that should be
            consumed. By default, one argument will be consumed and a single
            value will be produced.  Other values include:
                - N (an integer) consumes N arguments (and produces a list)
                - '?' consumes zero or one arguments
                - '*' consumes zero or more arguments (and produces a list)
                - '+' consumes one or more arguments (and produces a list)
            Note that the difference between the default and nargs=1 is that
            with the default, a single value will be produced, while with
            nargs=1, a list containing a single value will be produced.

        - const -- The value to be produced if the option is specified and the
            option uses an action that takes no values.

        - default -- The value to be produced if the option is not specified.

        - type -- A callable that accepts a single string argument, and
            returns the converted value.  The standard Python types str, int,
            float, and complex are useful examples of such callables.  If None,
            str is used.

        - choices -- A container of values that should be allowed. If not None,
            after a command-line argument has been converted to the appropriate
            type, an exception will be raised if it is not a member of this
            collection.

        - required -- True if the action must always be specified at the
            command line. This is only meaningful for optional command-line
            arguments.

        - help -- The help string describing the argument.

'u'argparse'u'array(typecode [, initializer]) -> array

Return a new array whose items are restricted by typecode, and
initialized from the optional initializer value, which must be a list,
string or iterable over elements of the appropriate type.

Arrays represent basic values and behave very much like lists, except
the type of objects stored in them is constrained. The type is specified
at object creation time by using a type code, which is a single character.
The following type codes are defined:

    Type code   C Type             Minimum size in bytes
    'b'         signed integer     1
    'B'         unsigned integer   1
    'u'         Unicode character  2 (see note)
    'h'         signed integer     2
    'H'         unsigned integer   2
    'i'         signed integer     2
    'I'         unsigned integer   2
    'l'         signed integer     4
    'L'         unsigned integer   4
    'q'         signed integer     8 (see note)
    'Q'         unsigned integer   8 (see note)
    'f'         floating point     4
    'd'         floating point     8

NOTE: The 'u' typecode corresponds to Python's unicode character. On
narrow builds this is 2-bytes on wide builds this is 4-bytes.

NOTE: The 'q' and 'Q' type codes are only available if the platform
C compiler used to build Python supports 'long long', or, on Windows,
'__int64'.

    ast
    ~~~

    The `ast` module helps Python applications to process trees of the Python
    abstract syntax grammar.  The abstract syntax itself might change with
    each Python release; this module helps to find out programmatically what
    the current grammar looks like and allows modifications of it.

    An abstract syntax tree can be generated by passing `ast.PyCF_ONLY_AST` as
    a flag to the `compile()` builtin function or by using the `parse()`
    function from this module.  The result will be a tree of objects whose
    classes all inherit from `ast.AST`.

    A modified abstract syntax tree can be compiled into a Python code object
    using the built-in `compile()` function.

    Additionally various helper functions are provided that make working with
    the trees simpler.  The main intention of the helper functions and this
    module in general is to provide an easy to use interface for libraries
    that work tightly with the python syntax (template engines for example).

type_commentsfeature_version
    Parse the source into an AST node.
    Equivalent to compile(source, filename, mode, PyCF_ONLY_AST).
    Pass type_comments=True to get back type comments where the syntax allows.
    _feature_versionliteral_evalnode_or_string
    Safely evaluate an expression node or a string containing a Python
    expression.  The string or node provided may only consist of the following
    Python literal structures: strings, bytes, numbers, tuples, lists, dicts,
    sets, booleans, and None.
    _raise_malformed_nodenodemalformed node or string: _convert_num_convert_signed_numoperand_converteltsleftrightannotate_fieldsinclude_attributes
    Return a formatted dump of the tree in node.  This is mainly useful for
    debugging purposes.  If annotate_fields is true (by default),
    the returned string will show the names and the values for fields.
    If annotate_fields is false, the result string will be more compact by
    omitting unambiguous field names.  Attributes such as line
    numbers and column offsets are not dumped by default.  If this is wanted,
    include_attributes can be set to true.
    %s=%sexpected AST, got %rcopy_locationnew_nodeold_node
    Copy source location (`lineno`, `col_offset`, `end_lineno`, and `end_col_offset`
    attributes) from *old_node* to *new_node* if possible, and return *new_node*.
    col_offsetend_linenoend_col_offsetend_fix_missing_locations
    When you compile a node tree with compile(), the compiler expects lineno and
    col_offset attributes for every node that supports them.  This is rather
    tedious to fill in for generated nodes, so this helper adds these attributes
    recursively where not already set, by setting them to the values of the
    parent node.  It works recursively starting at *node*.
    childiter_child_nodesincrement_lineno
    Increment the line number and end line number of each node in the tree
    starting at *node* by *n*. This is useful to "move code" to a different
    location in a file.
    iter_fields
    Yield a tuple of ``(fieldname, value)`` for each field in ``node._fields``
    that is present on *node*.
    
    Yield all direct child nodes of *node*, that is, all fields that are nodes
    and all items of fields that are lists of nodes.
    get_docstringclean
    Return the docstring for the given node or None if no docstring can
    be found.  If the node provided does not have docstrings a TypeError
    will be raised.

    If *clean* is `True`, all tabs are expanded to spaces and any whitespace
    that can be uniformly removed from the second line onwards is removed.
    %r can't have docstringsStrcleandoc_splitlines_no_ffSplit a string into lines ignoring form feed and other chars.

    This mimics how the Python parser splits source code.
    next_line_pad_whitespaceReplace all chars except '\f\t' in a line with spaces.	get_source_segmentpaddedGet source code segment of the *source* that generated *node*.

    If some location information (`lineno`, `end_lineno`, `col_offset`,
    or `end_col_offset`) is missing, return None.

    If *padded* is `True`, the first line of a multi-line statement will
    be padded with spaces to match its original position.
    
    Recursively yield all descendant nodes in the tree starting at *node*
    (including *node* itself), in no specified order.  This is useful if you
    only want to modify nodes in place and don't care about the context.
    todoNodeVisitor
    A node visitor base class that walks the abstract syntax tree and calls a
    visitor function for every node found.  This function may return a value
    which is forwarded by the `visit` method.

    This class is meant to be subclassed, with the subclass adding visitor
    methods.

    Per default the visitor functions for the nodes are ``'visit_'`` +
    class name of the node.  So a `TryFinally` node visit function would
    be `visit_TryFinally`.  This behavior can be changed by overriding
    the `visit` method.  If no visitor function exists for a node
    (return value `None`) the `generic_visit` visitor is used instead.

    Don't use the `NodeVisitor` if you want to apply changes to nodes during
    traversing.  For this a special visitor exists (`NodeTransformer`) that
    allows modifications.
    visitVisit a node.visit_generic_visitvisitorCalled if no explicit visitor function exists for a node.visit_Constant_const_node_type_names is deprecated; add visit_ConstantNodeTransformer
    A :class:`NodeVisitor` subclass that walks the abstract syntax tree and
    allows modification of nodes.

    The `NodeTransformer` will walk the AST and use the return value of the
    visitor methods to replace or remove the old node.  If the return value of
    the visitor method is ``None``, the node will be removed from its location,
    otherwise it is replaced with the return value.  The return value may be the
    original node in which case no replacement takes place.

    Here is an example transformer that rewrites all occurrences of name lookups

       class RewriteName(NodeTransformer):

           def visit_Name(self, node):
               return Subscript(
                   value=Name(id='data', ctx=Load()),

                   ctx=node.ctx
               )

    Keep in mind that if the node you're operating on has child nodes you must
    either transform the child nodes yourself or call the :meth:`generic_visit`
    method for the node first.

    For nodes that were part of a collection of statements (that applies to all
    statement nodes), the visitor may also return a list of nodes rather than
    just a single node.

    Usually you use the transformer like this::

       node = YourTransformer().visit(node)

    The `ast` module helps Python applications to process trees of the Python
    abstract syntax grammar.  The abstract syntax itself might change with
    each Python release; this module helps to find out programmatically what
    the current grammar looks like and allows modifications of it.

    An abstract syntax tree can be generated by passing `ast.PyCF_ONLY_AST` as
    a flag to the `compile()` builtin function or by using the `parse()`
    function from this module.  The result will be a tree of objects whose
    classes all inherit from `ast.AST`.

    A modified abstract syntax tree can be compiled into a Python code object
    using the built-in `compile()` function.

    Additionally various helper functions are provided that make working with
    the trees simpler.  The main intention of the helper functions and this
    module in general is to provide an easy to use interface for libraries
    that work tightly with the python syntax (template engines for example).

    When you compile a node tree with compile(), the compiler expects lineno and
    col_offset attributes for every node that supports them.  This is rather
    tedious to fill in for generated nodes, so this helper adds these attributes
    recursively where not already set, by setting them to the values of the
    parent node.  It works recursively starting at *node*.

    A node visitor base class that walks the abstract syntax tree and calls a
    visitor function for every node found.  This function may return a value
    which is forwarded by the `visit` method.

    This class is meant to be subclassed, with the subclass adding visitor
    methods.

    Per default the visitor functions for the nodes are ``'visit_'`` +
    class name of the node.  So a `TryFinally` node visit function would
    be `visit_TryFinally`.  This behavior can be changed by overriding
    the `visit` method.  If no visitor function exists for a node
    (return value `None`) the `generic_visit` visitor is used instead.

    Don't use the `NodeVisitor` if you want to apply changes to nodes during
    traversing.  For this a special visitor exists (`NodeTransformer`) that
    allows modifications.

    A :class:`NodeVisitor` subclass that walks the abstract syntax tree and
    allows modification of nodes.

    The `NodeTransformer` will walk the AST and use the return value of the
    visitor methods to replace or remove the old node.  If the return value of
    the visitor method is ``None``, the node will be removed from its location,
    otherwise it is replaced with the return value.  The return value may be the
    original node in which case no replacement takes place.

    Here is an example transformer that rewrites all occurrences of name lookups
    (``foo``) to ``data['foo']``::

       class RewriteName(NodeTransformer):

           def visit_Name(self, node):
               return Subscript(
                   value=Name(id='data', ctx=Load()),

This module handles the content transfer encoding method defined in RFC 2045
to encode arbitrary 8-bit data using the three 8-bit bytes in four 7-bit
characters encoding known as Base64.

It is used in the MIME standards for email to attach images, audio, and text
using some 8-bit character sets to messages.

This module provides an interface to encode and decode both headers and bodies
with Base64 encoding.

RFC 2045 defines a method for including character set information in an
`encoded-word' in a header.  This method is commonly used for 8-bit real names
in To:, From:, Cc:, etc. fields, as well as Subject: lines.

This module does not do the line wrapping or end-of-line character conversion
necessary for proper internationalized headers; it only does dumb encoding and
decoding.  To deal with the various line wrapping issues, use the email.header
module.
body_decodebody_encodeheader_encodeheader_lengthCRLFNLMISC_LENReturn the length of s when it is encoded with base64.iso-8859-1header_bytesEncode a single header line with Base64 encoding in a given charset.

    charset names the character set to use to encode the header.  It defaults
    to iso-8859-1.  Base64 encoding is defined in RFC 2045.
    =?%s?b?%s?=eolEncode a string with base64.

    Each line will be wrapped at, at most, maxlinelen characters (defaults to
    76 characters).

    Each line of encoded text will end with eol, which defaults to "\n".  Set

This module handles the content transfer encoding method defined in RFC 2045
to encode arbitrary 8-bit data using the three 8-bit bytes in four 7-bit
characters encoding known as Base64.

It is used in the MIME standards for email to attach images, audio, and text
using some 8-bit character sets to messages.

This module provides an interface to encode and decode both headers and bodies
with Base64 encoding.

RFC 2045 defines a method for including character set information in an
`encoded-word' in a header.  This method is commonly used for 8-bit real names
in To:, From:, Cc:, etc. fields, as well as Subject: lines.

This module does not do the line wrapping or end-of-line character conversion
necessary for proper internationalized headers; it only does dumb encoding and
decoding.  To deal with the various line wrapping issues, use the email.header
module.

basicsCO_GENERATORCO_COROUTINECO_ASYNC_GENERATORBdbQuitBdbBreakpointGENERATOR_AND_COROUTINE_FLAGSException to give up completely.Generic Python debugger base class.

    This class takes care of details of the trace facility;
    a derived class should implement user interaction.
    The standard debugger class (pdb.Pdb) is an example.

    The optional skip argument must be an iterable of glob-style
    module name patterns.  The debugger will not step into frames
    that originate in a module that matches one of these patterns.
    Whether a frame is considered to originate in a certain module
    is determined by the __name__ in the frame globals.
    breaksfncacheframe_returningcanonicReturn canonical form of filename.

        For real filenames, the canonical form is a case-normalized (on
        case insensitive filesystems) absolute path.  'Filenames' with
        angle brackets, such as "<stdin>", generated in interactive
        mode, are returned unchanged.
        Set values of attributes as ready to start debugging.botframe_set_stopinfotrace_dispatchDispatch a trace function for debugged frames based on the event.

        This function is installed as the trace function for debugged
        frames. Its return value is the new trace function, which is
        usually itself. The default implementation decides how to
        dispatch a frame, depending on the type of event (passed in as a
        string) that is about to be executed.

        The event can be one of the following:
            line: A new line of code is going to be executed.
            call: A function is about to be called or another code block
                  is entered.
            return: A function or other code block is about to return.
            exception: An exception has occurred.
            c_call: A C function is about to be called.
            c_return: A C function has returned.
            c_exception: A C function has raised an exception.

        For the Python events, specialized functions (see the dispatch_*()
        methods) are called.  For the C events, no action is taken.

        The arg parameter depends on the previous event.

        Return self.trace_dispatch to continue tracing in this scope.
        user_exceptionis_skipped_moduleReturn True if module_name matches any skip pattern.Return True if frame is below the starting frame in the stack.Return True if there is an effective breakpoint for this line.

        Check for line or function breakpoint and if in effect.
        Delete temporary breakpoints if effective() says to.
        co_firstlinenoeffectivebpnumbercurrentbptemporarydo_clearRemove temporary breakpoint.

        Must implement in derived classes or get NotImplementedError.
        subclass of bdb must implement do_clear()Return True if there is any breakpoint for frame's filename.
        argument_listCalled if we might stop in a function.Called when we stop or break at a line.return_valueCalled when a return trap is set here.Called when we stop on an exception.Set the attributes for stopping.

        If stoplineno is greater than or equal to 0, then stop at line
        greater than or equal to the stopline.  If stoplineno is -1, then
        don't stop at all.
        set_untilStop when the line with the lineno greater than the current one is
        reached or when returning from current frame.set_stepStop after one line of code.caller_framef_traceset_nextStop on the next line in or below the given frame.set_returnStop when returning from the given frame.set_traceStart debugging from frame.

        If frame is not specified, debugging starts from caller's frame.
        set_continueStop only at breakpoints or when finished.

        If there are no breakpoints, set the system trace function to None.
        set_quitSet quitting attribute to True.

        Raises BdbQuit exception in the next call to a dispatch_*() method.
        set_breakcondfuncnameSet a new breakpoint for filename:lineno.

        If lineno doesn't exist for the filename, return an error message.
        The filename should be in canonical form.
        Line %s:%d does not exist_prune_breaksPrune breakpoints for filename:lineno.

        A list of breakpoints is maintained in the Bdb instance and in
        the Breakpoint class.  If a breakpoint in the Bdb instance no

    Implements temporary breakpoints, ignore counts, disabling and
    (re)-enabling, and conditionals.

    Breakpoints are indexed by number through bpbynumber and by
    the (file, line) tuple using bplist.  The former points to a
    single instance of class Breakpoint.  The latter points to a
    list of such instances since there may be more than one
    breakpoint per line.

    When creating a breakpoint, its associated filename should be
    in canonical form.  If funcname is defined, a breakpoint hit will be
    counted when the first line of that function is executed.  A
    conditional breakpoint always counts a hit.
    func_first_executable_linehitsDelete the breakpoint from the list associated to a file:line.

        If it is the last breakpoint in that position, it also deletes
        the entry for the file:line.
        Mark the breakpoint as enabled.Mark the breakpoint as disabled.bpprintPrint the output of bpformat().

        The optional out argument directs where the output is sent
        and defaults to standard output.
        bpformatReturn a string with information about the breakpoint.

        The information includes the breakpoint number, temporary
        status, file:line position, break condition, number of times to
        ignore, and number of times hit.

        del  dispkeep yes  no   %-4dbreakpoint   %s at %s:%d
	stop only if %s
	ignore next %d hits
	breakpoint already hit %d time%sReturn a condensed description of the breakpoint.breakpoint %s at %s:%scheckfuncnameReturn True if break should happen here.

    Whether a break should happen depends on the way that b (the breakpoint)
    was set.  If it was set via line number, check if b.line is the same as
    the one in the frame.  If it was set via function name, check if this is
    the right function and if it is on the first executable line.
    Determine which breakpoint for this file:line is to be acted upon.

    Called only if we know there is a breakpoint at this location.  Return
    the breakpoint that was triggered and a boolean that indicates if it is
    ok to delete a temporary breakpoint.  Return (None, None) if there is no
    matching breakpoint.

BZ2FileNadeem Vawda <nadeem.vawda@gmail.com>_builtin_open_compression_MODE_CLOSED_MODE_READ_MODE_WRITE_sentinelA file object providing transparent bzip2 (de)compression.

    A BZ2File can act as a wrapper for an existing file object, or refer
    directly to a named file on disk.

    Note that BZ2File provides a *binary* file interface - data read is
    returned as bytes, and data to be written should be given as bytes.
    bufferingcompresslevelOpen a bzip2-compressed file.

        If filename is a str, bytes, or PathLike object, it gives the
        name of the file to be opened. Otherwise, it should be a file
        object, which will be used to read or write the compressed data.

        mode can be 'r' for reading (default), 'w' for (over)writing,
        'x' for creating exclusively, or 'a' for appending. These can
        equivalently be given as 'rb', 'wb', 'xb', and 'ab'.

        buffering is ignored since Python 3.0. Its use is deprecated.

        If mode is 'w', 'x' or 'a', compresslevel can be a number between 1
        and 9 specifying the level of compression: 1 produces the least
        compression, and 9 (default) produces the most compression.

        If mode is 'r', the input file may be the concatenation of
        multiple compressed streams.
        _closefpUse of 'buffering' argument is deprecated and ignored since Python 3.0."Use of 'buffering' argument is deprecated and ignored ""since Python 3.0."compresslevel must be between 1 and 9mode_code_compressorxbabInvalid mode: %rfilename must be a str, bytes, file or PathLike object_bufferFlush and close the file.

        May be called more than once without error. Once the file is
        closed, any other operation on it will raise a ValueError.
        True if this file is closed.Return the file descriptor for the underlying file.Return whether the file supports seeking.Return whether the file was opened for reading.Return whether the file was opened for writing.Return buffered data without advancing the file position.

        Always returns at least one byte of data, unless at EOF.
        The exact number of bytes returned is unspecified.
        Read up to size uncompressed bytes from the file.

        If size is negative or omitted, read until EOF is reached.
        Returns b'' if the file is already at EOF.
        Read up to size uncompressed bytes, while trying to avoid
        making multiple reads from the underlying stream. Reads up to a
        buffer's worth of data if size is negative.

        Returns b'' if the file is at EOF.
        Read bytes into b.

        Returns the number of bytes read (0 for EOF).
        Read a line of uncompressed bytes from the file.

        The terminating newline (if present) is retained. If size is
        non-negative, no more than size bytes will be read (in which
        case the line may be incomplete). Returns b'' if already at EOF.
        Integer argument expectedRead a list of lines of uncompressed bytes from the file.

        size can be specified to control the number of lines read: no
        further lines will be read once the total size of the lines read
        so far equals or exceeds size.
        Write a byte string to the file.

        Returns the number of uncompressed bytes written, which is
        always len(data). Note that due to buffering, the file on disk
        may not reflect the data written until close() is called.
        compressedWrite a sequence of byte strings to the file.

        Returns the number of uncompressed bytes written.
        seq can be any iterable yielding byte strings.

        Line separators are not added between the written byte strings.
        Change the file position.

        The new position is specified by offset, relative to the
        position indicated by whence. Values for whence are:

            0: start of stream (default); offset must not be negative
            1: current stream position
            2: end of stream; offset must not be positive

        Returns the new file position.

        Note that seeking is emulated, so depending on the parameters,
        this operation may be extremely slow.
        Open a bzip2-compressed file in binary or text mode.

    The filename argument can be an actual filename (a str, bytes, or
    PathLike object), or an existing file object to read from or write
    to.

    The mode argument can be "r", "rb", "w", "wb", "x", "xb", "a" or
    "ab" for binary mode, or "rt", "wt", "xt" or "at" for text mode.
    The default mode is "rb", and the default compresslevel is 9.

    For binary mode, this function is equivalent to the BZ2File
    constructor: BZ2File(filename, mode, compresslevel). In this case,
    the encoding, errors and newline arguments must not be provided.

    For text mode, a BZ2File object is created, and wrapped in an
    io.TextIOWrapper instance with the specified encoding, error
    handling behavior, and line ending(s).

    Argument 'encoding' not supported in binary modeArgument 'errors' not supported in binary modeArgument 'newline' not supported in binary modebz_modebinary_fileCompress a block of data.

    compresslevel, if given, must be a number between 1 and 9.

    For incremental decompression, use a BZ2Decompressor object instead.

    A BZ2File can act as a wrapper for an existing file object, or refer
    directly to a named file on disk.

    Note that BZ2File provides a *binary* file interface - data read is
    returned as bytes, and data to be written should be given as bytes.

    'b'Open a bzip2-compressed file.

        If filename is a str, bytes, or PathLike object, it gives the
        name of the file to be opened. Otherwise, it should be a file
        object, which will be used to read or write the compressed data.

        mode can be 'r' for reading (default), 'w' for (over)writing,
        'x' for creating exclusively, or 'a' for appending. These can
        equivalently be given as 'rb', 'wb', 'xb', and 'ab'.

        buffering is ignored since Python 3.0. Its use is deprecated.

        If mode is 'w', 'x' or 'a', compresslevel can be a number between 1
        and 9 specifying the level of compression: 1 produces the least
        compression, and 9 (default) produces the most compression.

        If mode is 'r', the input file may be the concatenation of
        multiple compressed streams.

    By default, the test code itself should be placed in a method named
    'runTest'.

    If the fixture may be used for many test cases, create as
    many test methods as are needed. When instantiating such a TestCase
    subclass, specify in the constructor arguments the name of the test method
    that the instance is to execute.

    Test authors should subclass TestCase for their own tests. Construction
    and deconstruction of the test's environment ('fixture') can be
    implemented by overriding the 'setUp' and 'tearDown' methods respectively.

    If it is necessary to override the __init__ method, the base class
    __init__ method must always be called. It is important that subclasses
    should not change the signature of their __init__ method, since instances
    of the classes are instantiated automatically by parts of the framework
    in order to be run.

    When subclassing TestCase, you can set these attributes:
    * failureException: determines which exception will be raised when
        the instance's assertion methods fail; test methods raising this
        exception will be deemed to have 'failed' rather than 'errored'.
    * longMessage: determines whether long messages (including repr of
        objects used in assert methods) will be printed on failure in *addition*
        to any explicit message passed.
    * maxDiff: sets the maximum length of a diff in failure messages
        by assert methods using difflib. It is looked up as an instance
        attribute so can be configured by individual tests if required.
    longMessagemaxDiff_diffThreshold_classSetupFailed_class_cleanupsCreate an instance of the class that will use the named test

        This method is for use by TestCase subclasses that need to register
        their own type equality functions to provide nicer error messages.

        Args:
            typeobj: The data type to call this function on when both values
                    are of the same type in assertEqual().
            function: The callable taking two arguments and an optional
                    msg= argument that raises self.failureException with a
                    useful error message when the two arguments are not equal.
        Add a function, with arguments, to be called when the test is
        completed. Functions added are called on a LIFO basis and are
        called after tearDown on test failure or success.

        If longMessage is False this means:
        * Use only an explicit message if it is provided
        * Otherwise use the standard message for the assert

        If longMessage is True:
        * Use the standard message
        * If an explicit message is provided, plus ' : ' and the explicit message
        %s : %sexpected_exceptionFail unless an exception of class expected_exception is raised
           by the callable when invoked with specified positional and
           keyword arguments. If a different type of exception is
           raised, it will not be caught, and the test case will be
           deemed to have suffered an error, exactly as for an
           unexpected exception.

           If called with the callable and arguments omitted, will return a
           context object used like this::

                with self.assertRaises(SomeException):
                    do_something()

           An optional keyword argument 'msg' can be provided when assertRaises
           is used as a context object.

           The context manager keeps a reference to the exception as
           the 'exception' attribute. This allows you to inspect the
           exception after the assertion::

               with self.assertRaises(SomeException) as cm:
                   do_something()
               the_exception = cm.exception
               self.assertEqual(the_exception.error_code, 3)
        assertWarnsexpected_warningFail unless a warning of class warnClass is triggered
           by the callable when invoked with specified positional and
           keyword arguments.  If a different type of warning is
           triggered, it will not be handled: depending on the other
           warning filtering rules in effect, it might be silenced, printed
           out, or raised as an exception.

           If called with the callable and arguments omitted, will return a
           context object used like this::

                with self.assertWarns(SomeWarning):
                    do_something()

           An optional keyword argument 'msg' can be provided when assertWarns
           is used as a context object.

           The context manager keeps a reference to the first matching
           warning as the 'warning' attribute; similarly, the 'filename'
           and 'lineno' attributes give you information about the line
           of Python code from which the warning was triggered.
           This allows you to inspect the warning after the assertion::

               with self.assertWarns(SomeWarning) as cm:
                   do_something()
               the_warning = cm.warning
               self.assertEqual(the_warning.some_attribute, 147)
        assertLogsFail unless a log message of level *level* or higher is emitted
        on *logger_name* or its children.  If omitted, *level* defaults to
        INFO and *logger* defaults to the root logger.

        This method must be used as a context manager, and will yield
        a recording object with two attributes: `output` and `records`.
        At the end of the context manager, the `output` attribute will
        be a list of the matching formatted log messages and the
        `records` attribute will be a list of the corresponding LogRecord
        objects.

        Example::

            with self.assertLogs('foo', level='INFO') as cm:
                logging.getLogger('foo').info('first message')
                logging.getLogger('foo.bar').error('second message')
            self.assertEqual(cm.output, ['INFO:foo:first message',
                                         'ERROR:foo.bar:second message'])
        _getAssertEqualityFuncGet a detailed comparison function for the types of the two args.

        Returns: A callable accepting (first, second, msg=None) that will
        raise a failure exception if first != second with a useful human
        readable error message for those types.

        assertSetEqual uses ducktyping to support different types of sets, and

    By default, the test code itself should be placed in a method named
    'runTest'.

    If the fixture may be used for many test cases, create as
    many test methods as are needed. When instantiating such a TestCase
    subclass, specify in the constructor arguments the name of the test method
    that the instance is to execute.

    Test authors should subclass TestCase for their own tests. Construction
    and deconstruction of the test's environment ('fixture') can be
    implemented by overriding the 'setUp' and 'tearDown' methods respectively.

    If it is necessary to override the __init__ method, the base class
    __init__ method must always be called. It is important that subclasses
    should not change the signature of their __init__ method, since instances
    of the classes are instantiated automatically by parts of the framework
    in order to be run.

    When subclassing TestCase, you can set these attributes:
    * failureException: determines which exception will be raised when
        the instance's assertion methods fail; test methods raising this
        exception will be deemed to have 'failed' rather than 'errored'.
    * longMessage: determines whether long messages (including repr of
        objects used in assert methods) will be printed on failure in *addition*
        to any explicit message passed.
    * maxDiff: sets the maximum length of a diff in failure messages
        by assert methods using difflib. It is looked up as an instance
        attribute so can be configured by individual tests if required.

        This method must be used as a context manager, and will yield
        a recording object with two attributes: `output` and `records`.
        At the end of the context manager, the `output` attribute will

Contains CCompiler, an abstract base class that defines the interface
for the Distutils compiler abstraction model.distutils.file_utilmove_filedistutils.dep_utilnewer_pairwisenewer_groupsplit_quotedCCompilerAbstract base class to define the interface that must be implemented
    by real compiler classes.  Also has some utility methods used by
    several compiler classes.

    The basic idea behind a compiler abstraction class is that each
    instance can be used for all the compile/link steps in building a
    single project.  Thus, attributes common to all of those compile and
    link steps -- include directories, macros to define, libraries to link
    against, etc. -- are attributes of the compiler instance.  To allow for
    variability in how individual files are treated, most of those
    attributes may be varied on a per-compilation or per-link basis.
    compiler_typesrc_extensionsobj_extensionstatic_lib_extensionshared_lib_extensionstatic_lib_formatshared_lib_formatexe_extension.cc++.cc.cpp.cxxobjc.mlanguage_maplanguage_orderoutput_dirmacrosinclude_dirslibrarieslibrary_dirsruntime_library_dirsset_executableset_executablesDefine the executables (and options for them) that will be run
        to perform the various stages of compilation.  The exact set of
        executables that may be specified here depends on the compiler
        class (via the 'executables' class attribute), but most will have:
          compiler      the C/C++ compiler
          linker_so     linker used to create shared objects and libraries
          linker_exe    linker used to create binary executables
          archiver      static library creator

        On platforms with a command-line (Unix, DOS/Windows), each of these
        is a string that will be split into executable name and (optional)
        list of arguments.  (Splitting the string is done similarly to how
        Unix shells operate: words are delimited by spaces, but quotes and
        backslashes can override this.  See
        'distutils.util.split_quoted()'.)
        unknown executable '%s' for class %s_find_macrodefn_check_macro_definitionsdefinitionsEnsures that every element of 'definitions' is a valid macro
        definition, ie. either (name,value) 2-tuple or a (name,) tuple.  Do
        nothing if all definitions are OK, raise TypeError otherwise.
        invalid macro definition '%s': must be tuple (string,), (string, string), or (string, None)define_macroDefine a preprocessor macro for all compilations driven by this
        compiler object.  The optional parameter 'value' should be a
        string; if it is not supplied, then the macro will be defined
        without an explicit value and the exact outcome depends on the
        compiler used (XXX true? does ANSI say anything about this?)
        undefine_macroUndefine a preprocessor macro for all compilations driven by
        this compiler object.  If the same macro is defined by
        'define_macro()' and undefined by 'undefine_macro()' the last call
        takes precedence (including multiple redefinitions or
        undefinitions).  If the macro is redefined/undefined on a
        per-compilation basis (ie. in the call to 'compile()'), then that
        takes precedence.
        undefnadd_include_dirAdd 'dir' to the list of directories that will be searched for
        header files.  The compiler is instructed to search directories in
        the order in which they are supplied by successive calls to
        'add_include_dir()'.
        set_include_dirsSet the list of directories that will be searched to 'dirs' (a
        list of strings).  Overrides any preceding calls to
        'add_include_dir()'; subsequence calls to 'add_include_dir()' add
        to the list passed to 'set_include_dirs()'.  This does not affect
        any list of standard include directories that the compiler may
        search by default.
        add_libraryAdd 'libname' to the list of libraries that will be included in
        all links driven by this compiler object.  Note that 'libname'
        should *not* be the name of a file containing a library, but the
        name of the library itself: the actual filename will be inferred by
        the linker, the compiler, or the compiler class (depending on the
        platform).

        The linker will be instructed to link against libraries in the
        order they were supplied to 'add_library()' and/or
        'set_libraries()'.  It is perfectly valid to duplicate library
        names; the linker will be instructed to link against libraries as
        many times as they are mentioned.
        set_librariesSet the list of libraries to be included in all links driven by
        this compiler object to 'libnames' (a list of strings).  This does
        not affect any standard system libraries that the linker may
        include by default.
        add_library_dirAdd 'dir' to the list of directories that will be searched for
        libraries specified to 'add_library()' and 'set_libraries()'.  The
        linker will be instructed to search for libraries in the order they
        are supplied to 'add_library_dir()' and/or 'set_library_dirs()'.
        set_library_dirsSet the list of library search directories to 'dirs' (a list of
        strings).  This does not affect any standard library search path
        that the linker may search by default.
        add_runtime_library_dirAdd 'dir' to the list of directories that will be searched for
        shared libraries at runtime.
        set_runtime_library_dirsSet the list of directories to search for shared libraries at
        runtime to 'dirs' (a list of strings).  This does not affect any
        standard search path that the runtime linker may search by
        default.
        add_link_objectAdd 'object' to the list of object files (or analogues, such as
        explicitly named library files or the output of "resource
        compilers") to be included in every link driven by this compiler
        object.
        set_link_objectsSet the list of object files (or analogues) to be included in
        every link to 'objects'.  This does not affect any standard object
        files that the linker may include by default (such as system
        libraries).

        extlangextindexpreprocessextra_preargsextra_postargsPreprocess a single C/C++ source file, named in 'source'.
        Output will be written to file named 'output_file', or stdout if
        'output_file' not supplied.  'macros' is a list of macro
        definitions as for 'compile()', which will augment the macros set
        with 'define_macro()' and 'undefine_macro()'.  'include_dirs' is a
        list of directory names that will be added to the default list.

        Raises PreprocessError on failure.
        Compile one or more source files.

        'sources' must be a list of filenames, most likely C/C++
        files, but in reality anything that can be handled by a
        particular compiler and compiler class (eg. MSVCCompiler can
        handle resource files in 'sources').  Return a list of object
        filenames, one per source filename in 'sources'.  Depending on
        the implementation, not all source files will necessarily be
        compiled, but all corresponding object filenames will be
        returned.

        If 'output_dir' is given, object files will be put under it, while
        retaining their original path component.  That is, "foo/bar.c"
        normally compiles to "foo/bar.o" (for a Unix implementation); if
        'output_dir' is "build", then it would compile to
        "build/foo/bar.o".

        'macros', if given, must be a list of macro definitions.  A macro
        definition is either a (name, value) 2-tuple or a (name,) 1-tuple.
        The former defines a macro; if the value is None, the macro is
        defined without an explicit value.  The 1-tuple case undefines a
        macro.  Later definitions/redefinitions/ undefinitions take
        precedence.

        'include_dirs', if given, must be a list of strings, the
        directories to add to the default include file search path for this
        compilation only.

        'debug' is a boolean; if true, the compiler will be instructed to
        output debug symbols in (or alongside) the object file(s).

        'extra_preargs' and 'extra_postargs' are implementation- dependent.
        On platforms that have the notion of a command-line (e.g. Unix,
        DOS/Windows), they are most likely lists of strings: extra
        command-line arguments to prepend/append to the compiler command
        line.  On other platforms, consult the implementation class
        documentation.  In any event, they are intended as an escape hatch
        for those occasions when the abstract compiler framework doesn't
        cut the mustard.

        'depends', if given, is a list of filenames that all targets
        depend on.  If a source file is older than any file in
        depends, then the source file will be recompiled.  This
        supports dependency tracking, but only at a coarse
        granularity.

        Raises CompileError on failure.
        _compileCompile 'src' to product 'obj'.create_static_liboutput_libnametarget_langLink a bunch of stuff together to create a static library file.
        The "bunch of stuff" consists of the list of object files supplied
        as 'objects', the extra object files supplied to
        'add_link_object()' and/or 'set_link_objects()', the libraries
        supplied to 'add_library()' and/or 'set_libraries()', and the
        libraries supplied as 'libraries' (if any).

        'output_libname' should be a library name, not a filename; the
        filename will be inferred from the library name.  'output_dir' is
        the directory where the library file will be put.

        'debug' is a boolean; if true, debugging information will be
        included in the library (note that on most platforms, it is the
        compile step where this matters: the 'debug' flag is included here
        just for consistency).

        'target_lang' is the target language for which the given objects
        are being compiled. This allows specific linkage time treatment of
        certain languages.

        Raises LibError on failure.
        shared_objectSHARED_OBJECTshared_librarySHARED_LIBRARYEXECUTABLEtarget_descoutput_filenameexport_symbolsbuild_tempLink a bunch of stuff together to create an executable or
        shared library file.

        The "bunch of stuff" consists of the list of object files supplied
        as 'objects'.  'output_filename' should be a filename.  If
        'output_dir' is supplied, 'output_filename' is relative to it
        (i.e. 'output_filename' can provide directory components if
        needed).

        'libraries' is a list of libraries to link against.  These are
        library names, not filenames, since they're translated into
        filenames in a platform-specific way (eg. "foo" becomes "libfoo.a"
        on Unix and "foo.lib" on DOS/Windows).  However, they can include a
        directory component, which means the linker will look in that
        specific directory rather than searching all the normal locations.

        'library_dirs', if supplied, should be a list of directories to
        search for libraries that were specified as bare library names
        (ie. no directory component).  These are on top of the system
        default and those supplied to 'add_library_dir()' and/or
        'set_library_dirs()'.  'runtime_library_dirs' is a list of
        directories that will be embedded into the shared library and used
        to search for other shared libraries that *it* depends on at
        run-time.  (This may only be relevant on Unix.)

        'export_symbols' is a list of symbols that the shared library will
        export.  (This appears to be relevant only on Windows.)

        'debug' is as for 'compile()' and 'create_static_lib()', with the
        slight distinction that it actually matters on most platforms (as
        opposed to 'create_static_lib()', which includes a 'debug' flag
        mostly for form's sake).

        'extra_preargs' and 'extra_postargs' are as for 'compile()' (except
        of course that they supply command-line arguments for the
        particular linker being used).

        'target_lang' is the target language for which the given objects
        are being compiled. This allows specific linkage time treatment of
        certain languages.

        Raises LinkError on failure.

To enable this module, do:

at the top of your script.  The optional arguments to enable() are:

    display     - if true, tracebacks are displayed in the web browser

By default, tracebacks are displayed but not saved, the context is 5 lines

Alternatively, if you have caught an exception and want cgitb to display it
for you, call cgitb.handler().  The optional argument to handler() is a
3-item tuple (etype, evalue, etb) just like the value of sys.exc_info().

    Optional header_enc and body_enc is either Charset.QP for
    quoted-printable, Charset.BASE64 for base64 encoding, Charset.SHORTEST for
    the shortest of qp or base64 encoding, or None for no encoding.  SHORTEST
    is only valid for header_enc.  It describes how message headers and
    message bodies in the input charset are to be encoded.  Default is no
    encoding.

    Optional output_charset is the character set that the output should be
    in.  Conversions will proceed from input charset, to Unicode, to the
    output charset when the method Charset.convert() is called.  The default
    is to output in the same character set as the input.

    Both input_charset and output_charset must have Unicode codec entries in
    the module's charset-to-codec mapping; use add_codec(charset, codecname)
    to add codecs the module does not know about.  See the codecs module's
    documentation for more information.
    SHORTEST not allowed for body_encAdd a character set alias.

    alias is the alias name, e.g. latin-1
    canonical is the character set's canonical name, e.g. iso-8859-1
    codecnameAdd a codec that map characters in the given charset to/from Unicode.

    charset is the canonical name of a character set.  codecname is the name
    of a Python codec, as appropriate for the second argument to the unicode()
    built-in, or to the encode() method of a Unicode string.
    _encodecodecMap character sets to their email properties.

    This class provides information about the requirements imposed on email
    for a specific character set.  It also provides convenience routines for
    converting between character sets, given the availability of the
    applicable codecs.  Given a character set, it will do its best to provide
    information on how to use that character set in an email in an
    RFC-compliant way.

    Certain character sets must be encoded with quoted-printable or base64
    when used in email headers or bodies.  Certain character sets must be
    converted outright, and are not allowed in email.  Instances of this
    module expose the following information about a character set:

    input_charset: The initial character set specified.  Common aliases
                   are converted to their `official' email names (e.g. latin_1
                   is converted to iso-8859-1).  Defaults to 7-bit us-ascii.

    header_encoding: If the character set must be encoded before it can be
                     used in an email header, this attribute will be set to
                     Charset.QP (for quoted-printable), Charset.BASE64 (for
                     base64 encoding), or Charset.SHORTEST for the shortest of
                     QP or BASE64 encoding.  Otherwise, it will be None.

    body_encoding: Same as header_encoding, but describes the encoding for the
                   mail message's body, which indeed may be different than the
                   header encoding.  Charset.SHORTEST is not allowed for
                   body_encoding.

    output_charset: Some character sets must be converted before they can be
                    used in email headers or bodies.  If the input_charset is
                    one of them, this attribute will contain the name of the
                    charset output will be converted to.  Otherwise, it will
                    be None.

    input_codec: The name of the Python codec used to convert the
                 input_charset to Unicode.  If no conversion codec is
                 necessary, this attribute will be None.

    output_codec: The name of the Python codec used to convert Unicode
                  to the output_charset.  If no conversion codec is necessary,
                  this attribute will have the same value as the input_codec.
    input_charsethencbencconvheader_encodingbody_encodinginput_codecoutput_codecget_body_encodingReturn the content-transfer-encoding used for body encoding.

        This is either the string `quoted-printable' or `base64' depending on
        the encoding used, or it is a function in which case you should call
        the function with a single argument, the Message object being
        encoded.  The function should then set the Content-Transfer-Encoding
        header itself to whatever is appropriate.

        Returns "quoted-printable" if self.body_encoding is QP.
        Returns "base64" if self.body_encoding is BASE64.
        Returns conversion function otherwise.
        quoted-printableget_output_charsetReturn the output character set.

        This is self.output_charset if that is not None, otherwise it is
        self.input_charset.
        Header-encode a string by converting it first to bytes.

        The type of encoding (base64 or quoted-printable) will be based on
        this charset's `header_encoding`.

        :param string: A unicode string for the header.  It must be possible
            to encode this string to bytes using the character set's
            output codec.
        :return: The encoded string, with RFC 2047 chrome.
        _get_encoderencoder_moduleheader_encode_linesmaxlengthsHeader-encode a string by converting it first to bytes.

        This is similar to `header_encode()` except that the string is fit
        into maximum line lengths as given by the argument.

        :param string: A unicode string for the header.  It must be possible
            to encode this string to bytes using the character set's
            output codec.
        :param maxlengths: Maximum line length iterator.  Each element
            returned from this iterator will provide the next maximum line
            length.  This parameter is used as an argument to built-in next()
            and should never be exhausted.  The maximum line lengths should
            not count the RFC 2047 chrome.  These line lengths are only a
            hint; the splitter does the best it can.
        :return: Lines of encoded strings, each with RFC 2047 chrome.
        current_linethis_lineseparatorjoined_linelen64lenqpBody-encode a string by converting it first to bytes.

        The type of encoding (base64 or quoted-printable) will be based on
        self.body_encoding.  If body_encoding is None, we assume the
        output charset is a 7bit encoding, so re-encoding the decoded
        string using the ascii codec produces the correct string version
        of the content.

<intro stuff goes here>
<other stuff, too>

HTTPConnection goes through a number of "states", which define when a client
may legally make another request or fetch the response for a particular
request. This diagram details these state transitions:

    (null)
      |
      | HTTPConnection()
      v
    Idle
      |
      | putrequest()
      v
    Request-started
      |
      | ( putheader() )*  endheaders()
      v
    Request-sent
      |\_____________________________
      |                              | getresponse() raises
      | response = getresponse()     | ConnectionError
      v                              v
    Unread-response                Idle
    [Response-headers-read]
      |\____________________

      | response.read()     | putrequest()
      v                     v
    Idle                  Req-started-unread-response
                     ______/|
                   /        |
   response.read() |        | ( putheader() )*  endheaders()
                   v        v
       Request-started    Req-sent-unread-response
                            |
                            | response.read()
                            v
                          Request-sent

This diagram presents the following rules:
  -- a second request may not be started until {response-headers-read}
  -- a response [object] cannot be retrieved until {request-sent}
  -- there is no differentiation between an unread response body and a
     partially read response body

Note: this enforcement is applied by the HTTPConnection class. The
      HTTPResponse class does not enforce this state machine, which
      implies sophisticated clients may accelerate the request/response
      pipeline. Caution should be taken, though: accelerating the states
      beyond the above pattern may imply knowledge of the server's
      connection-close behavior for certain requests. For example, it
      is impossible to tell whether the server will close the connection
      UNTIL the response headers have been read; this means that further
      requests cannot be placed into the pipeline until it is known that
      the server will NOT be closing the connection.

Use %s.encode('utf-8') ""if you want to send it encoded in UTF-8."HTTPMessageMessageFind all header lines matching a given header name.

        Look through the list of headers and find all lines matching a given
        header name (and their continuation lines).  A list of the lines is
        returned, without interpretation.  If the header does not occur, an
        empty list is returned.  If the header occurs multiple times, all
        occurrences are returned.  Case is not important in the header name.

        hit_read_headersReads potential header lines into a list from a file pointer.

    Length of line is limited by _MAXLINE, and number of
    headers is limited by _MAXHEADERS.
    header linegot more than %d headersparse_headers_classParses only RFC2822 headers from a file pointer.

    email Parser wants to see strings rather than bytes.
    But a TextIOWrapper around self.rfile would buffer too many bytes
    from the stream, bytes which we later need to read as bytes.
    So we read the correct bytes here, as bytes, for email Parser
    to parse.

        _readinto_chunked_read_next_chunk_sizechunk size_read_and_discard_trailertrailer line_get_chunk_lefttotal_bytesmvb_safe_readintotemp_mvbRead the number of bytes requested.

        This function should be used when <amt> bytes "should" be present for
        reading. If the bytes are truly not available (due to EOF), then the
        IncompleteRead exception can be used to detect the problem.
        Same as _safe_read, but for reading into a buffer.Read with at most one underlying system call.  If at least one
        byte is buffered, return that instead.
        _read1_chunked_peek_chunkedgetheaderReturns the value of the header matching *name*.

        If there are multiple matching headers, the values are
        combined into a single string separated by commas and spaces.

        If no matching header is found, returns *default* or None if
        the *default* is not specified.

        If the headers are unknown, raises http.client.ResponseNotReady.

        Return list of (header, value) tuples.Returns an instance of the class mimetools.Message containing
        meta-information associated with the URL.

        When the method is HTTP, these headers are those returned by
        the server at the head of the retrieved HTML page (including
        Content-Length and Content-Type).

        When the method is FTP, a Content-Length header will be
        present if (as is now usual) the server passed back a file
        length in response to the FTP retrieval request. A
        Content-Type header will be present if the MIME type can be
        guessed.

        When the method is local-file, returned headers will include
        a Date representing the file's last-modified time, a
        Content-Length giving file size, and a Content-Type
        containing a guess at the file's type. See also the
        description of the mimetools module.

        Return the real URL of the page.

        In some cases, the HTTP server redirects a client to another
        URL. The urlopen() function handles this transparently, but in
        some cases the caller needs to know which URL the client was
        redirected to. The geturl() method can be used to get at this
        redirected URL.

        getcodeReturn the HTTP status code that was sent with the response,
        or None if the URL is not an HTTP URL.

        _http_vsnHTTP/1.1_http_vsn_strresponse_classdefault_portauto_open_is_textIOTest whether a file-like object is a text or a binary stream.
        TextIOBase_get_content_lengthGet the content-length based on the body.

        If the body is None, we set Content-Length: 0 for methods that expect
        a body (RFC 7230, Section 3.3.2). We also set the Content-Length for
        any method if the body is a str or bytes-like object and not a file.
        mv_GLOBAL_DEFAULT_TIMEOUTsource_address__response__state_tunnel_host_tunnel_port_tunnel_headers_get_hostport_validate_host_create_connectionset_tunnelSet up host and port for HTTP CONNECT tunnelling.

        In a connection that uses HTTP CONNECT tunneling, the host passed to the
        constructor is used as a proxy server that relays all communication to
        the endpoint passed to `set_tunnel`. This done by sending an HTTP
        CONNECT request to the proxy server when the connection is established.

        This method must be called before the HTTP connection has been
        established.

        The headers argument should be a mapping of extra HTTP headers to send
        with the CONNECT request.

        not be handled, ResponseNotReady is raised.  If the HTTP
        response indicates that the connection should be closed, then
        it will be closed before the response is returned.  When the
        connection is closed, the underlying socket is closed.

This diagram presents the following rules:
  -- a second request may not be started until {response-headers-read}
  -- a response [object] cannot be retrieved until {request-sent}
  -- there is no differentiation between an unread response body and a
     partially read response body

Note: this enforcement is applied by the HTTPConnection class. The
      HTTPResponse class does not enforce this state machine, which
      implies sophisticated clients may accelerate the request/response
      pipeline. Caution should be taken, though: accelerating the states
      beyond the above pattern may imply knowledge of the server's
      connection-close behavior for certain requests. For example, it
      is impossible to tell whether the server will close the connection
      UNTIL the response headers have been read; this means that further
      requests cannot be placed into the pipeline until it is known that
      the server will NOT be closing the connection.

        meta-information associated with the URL.

        When the method is HTTP, these headers are those returned by
        the server at the head of the retrieved HTML page (including
        Content-Length and Content-Type).

        When the method is FTP, a Content-Length header will be
        present if (as is now usual) the server passed back a file
        length in response to the FTP retrieval request. A
        Content-Type header will be present if the MIME type can be
        guessed.

        When the method is local-file, returned headers will include
        a Date representing the file's last-modified time, a
        Content-Length giving file size, and a Content-Type
        containing a guess at the file's type. See also the
        description of the mimetools module.

        'b'Return the real URL of the page.

        In some cases, the HTTP server redirects a client to another
        URL. The urlopen() function handles this transparently, but in
        some cases the caller needs to know which URL the client was
        redirected to. The geturl() method can be used to get at this
        redirected URL.

        'b'Get the content-length based on the body.

        If the body is None, we set Content-Length: 0 for methods that expect
        a body (RFC 7230, Section 3.3.2). We also set the Content-Length for
        any method if the body is a str or bytes-like object and not a file.

        'b'Set up host and port for HTTP CONNECT tunnelling.

        In a connection that uses HTTP CONNECT tunneling, the host passed to the
        constructor is used as a proxy server that relays all communication to
        the endpoint passed to `set_tunnel`. This done by sending an HTTP
        CONNECT request to the proxy server when the connection is established.

        This method must be called before the HTTP connection has been
        established.

        The headers argument should be a mapping of extra HTTP headers to send
        with the CONNECT request.

    Convert an argument tuple or a Fault instance to an XML-RPC
    request (or response, if the methodresponse option is used).

    In addition to the data object, the following options can be given
    as keyword arguments:

        methodname: the method name for a methodCall packet

        methodresponse: true to create a methodResponse packet.
        If this option is used with a tuple, the tuple must be
        a singleton (i.e. it can contain only one element).

        encoding: the packet encoding (default is UTF-8)

    All byte strings in the data structure are assumed to use the
    packet encoding.  Unicode strings are automatically converted,
    where necessary.

Provides the Command class, the base class for the command classes
in the distutils.command package.
dir_utilfile_utilarchive_utildep_utilAbstract base class for defining command classes, the "worker bees"
    of the Distutils.  A useful analogy for command classes is to think of
    them as subroutines with local variables called "options".  The options
    are "declared" in 'initialize_options()' and "defined" (given their
    final values, aka "finalized") in 'finalize_options()', both of which
    must be defined by every command class.  The distinction between the
    two is necessary because option values might come from the outside
    world (command line, config file, ...), and any options dependent on
    other options must be computed *after* these outside influences have
    been processed -- hence 'finalize_options()'.  The "body" of the
    subroutine, where it does all its work based on the values of its
    options, is the 'run()' method, which must also be implemented by every
    command class.
    sub_commandsCreate and initialize a new Command object.  Most importantly,
        invokes the 'initialize_options()' method, which is the real
        initializer and depends on the actual command being
        instantiated.
        distutils.distdist must be a Distribution instanceCommand is an abstract classdistributioninitialize_options_dry_runfinalizedmyvalensure_finalizedfinalize_optionsSet default values for all the options that this command
        supports.  Note that these defaults may be overridden by other
        commands, by the setup script, by config files, or by the
        command-line.  Thus, this is not the place to code dependencies
        between options; generally, 'initialize_options()' implementations
        are just a bunch of "self.foo = None" assignments.

        This method must be implemented by all command classes.
        abstract method -- subclass %s must overrideSet final values for all the options that this command supports.
        This is always called as late as possible, ie.  after any option
        assignments from the command-line or from other commands have been
        done.  Thus, this is the place to code option dependencies: if
        'foo' depends on 'bar', then it is safe to set 'foo' from 'bar' as
        long as 'foo' still has the same value it was assigned in
        'initialize_options()'.

        This method must be implemented by all command classes.
        dump_optionslongopt_xlatecommand options for '%s':get_command_name  user_optionsA command's raison d'etre: carry out the action it exists to
        perform, controlled by the options initialized in
        'initialize_options()', customized by other commands, the setup
        script, the command-line, and config files, and finalized in
        'finalize_options()'.  All terminal output and filesystem
        interaction should be done by 'run()'.

        This method must be implemented by all command classes.

        option values in some other command object.  "Undefined" here means
        "is None", which is the convention used to indicate that an option
        has not been changed between 'initialize_options()' and
        'finalize_options()'.  Usually called from 'finalize_options()' for
        options that depend on some other command rather than another
        option of the same command.  'src_cmd' is the other command from
        which option values will be taken (a command object will be created
        for it if necessary); the remaining arguments are
        '(src_option,dst_option)' tuples which mean "take the value of
        'src_option' in the 'src_cmd' command object, and copy it to
        'dst_option' in the current command object".
        get_command_objsrc_cmd_objsrc_optiondst_optionget_finalized_commandcreateWrapper around Distribution's 'get_command_obj()' method: find
        (create if necessary and 'create' is true) the command object for
        'command', call its 'ensure_finalized()' method, and return the
        finalized command object.
        cmd_objrun_commandRun some other command: uses the 'run_command()' method of
        Distribution, which creates and finalizes the command object if
        necessary and then invokes its 'run()' method.

Interpreters constructed with this class obey the following conventions:

1. End of file on input is processed as the command 'EOF'.
2. A command is parsed out of each line by collecting the prefix composed
   of characters in the identchars member.
3. A command `foo' is dispatched to a method 'do_foo()'; the do_ method
   is passed a single argument consisting of the remainder of the line.
4. Typing an empty line repeats the last command.  (Actually, it calls the
   method `emptyline', which may be overridden in a subclass.)
5. There is a predefined `help' method.  Given an argument `topic', it
   calls the command `help_topic'.  With no arguments, it lists all topics
   with defined help_ functions, broken into up to three topics; documented
   commands, miscellaneous help topics, and undocumented commands.
6. The command '?' is a synonym for `help'.  The command '!' is a synonym
   for `shell', if a do_shell method exists.
7. If completion is enabled, completing commands will be done automatically,
   and completing of commands args is done by calling complete_foo() with
   arguments text, line, begidx, endidx.  text is string we are matching
   against, all returned matches must begin with it.  line is the current
   input line (lstripped), begidx and endidx are the beginning and end
   indexes of the text being matched, which could be used to provide
   different completion depending upon which position the argument is in.

The `default' method may be overridden to intercept commands for which there
is no do_ method.

The `completedefault' method may be overridden to intercept completions for
commands that have no complete_ method.

The data member `self.ruler' sets the character used to draw separator lines
in the help messages.  If empty, no ruler line is drawn.  It defaults to "=".

If the value of `self.intro' is nonempty when the cmdloop method is called,
it is printed out on interpreter startup.  This value may be overridden
via an optional argument to the cmdloop() method.

The data members `self.doc_header', `self.misc_header', and
`self.undoc_header' set the headers used for the help function's

    it's useful as a superclass of an interpreter class you define yourself
    in order to inherit Cmd's methods and encapsulate action methods.

    'u'A simple framework for writing line-oriented command interpreters.

    These are often useful for test harnesses, administrative tools, and

codeopCommandCompilercompile_commandInteractiveInterpreterInteractiveConsoleinteractBase class for InteractiveConsole.

    This class deals with parsing and interpreter state (the user's
    namespace); it doesn't deal with input buffering or prompting or
    input file naming (the filename is always passed in explicitly).

    Constructor.

        The optional 'locals' argument specifies the dictionary in
        which code will be executed; it defaults to a newly created
        dictionary with key "__name__" set to "__console__" and key
        "__doc__" set to None.

        __console__runsource<input>singlesymbolCompile and run some source in the interpreter.

        Arguments are as for compile_command().

        One of several things can happen:

        1) The input is incorrect; compile_command() raised an
        exception (SyntaxError or OverflowError).  A syntax traceback
        will be printed by calling the showsyntaxerror() method.

        2) The input is incomplete, and more input is required;
        compile_command() returned None.  Nothing happens.

        3) The input is complete; compile_command() returned a code
        object.  The code is executed by calling self.runcode() (which
        also handles run-time exceptions, except for SystemExit).

        The return value is True in case 2, False in the other cases (unless
        an exception is raised).  The return value can be used to
        decide whether to use sys.ps1 or sys.ps2 to prompt the next
        line.

        showsyntaxerrorruncodeExecute a code object.

        When an exception occurs, self.showtraceback() is called to
        display a traceback.  All exceptions are caught except
        SystemExit, which is reraised.

        A note about KeyboardInterrupt: this exception may occur
        elsewhere in this code, and may not always be caught.  The
        caller should be prepared to deal with it.

        showtracebackDisplay the syntax error that just occurred.

        This doesn't display a stack trace because there isn't one.

        If a filename is given, it is stuffed in the exception instead
        of what was there before (because Python's parser always uses
        "<string>" when reading from a string).

        The output is written by self.write(), below.

        last_typelast_valuelast_tracebackdummy_filenameDisplay the exception that just occurred.

        We remove the first stack item because it is our own code.

        The output is written by self.write(), below.

        last_tbWrite a string.

        The base implementation writes to sys.stderr; a subclass may
        replace this with a different implementation.

        Closely emulate the behavior of the interactive Python interpreter.

    This class builds on InteractiveInterpreter and adds prompting
    using the familiar sys.ps1 and sys.ps2, and input buffering.

    <console>Constructor.

        The optional locals argument will be passed to the
        InteractiveInterpreter base class.

        The optional filename argument should specify the (file)name
        of the input stream; it will show up in tracebacks.

        resetbufferReset the input buffer.bannerexitmsgClosely emulate the interactive Python console.

        The optional banner argument specifies the banner to print
        before the first interaction; by default it prints a banner
        similar to the one printed by the real Python interpreter,
        followed by the current class name in parentheses (so as not
        to confuse this with the real interpreter -- since it's so
        close!).

        The optional exitmsg argument specifies the exit message
        printed when exiting. Pass the empty string to suppress
        printing an exit message. If exitmsg is not given or None,
        a default message is printed.

Push a line to the interpreter.

        The line should not have a trailing newline; it may have
        internal newlines.  The line is appended to a buffer and the
        interpreter's runsource() method is called with the
        concatenated contents of the buffer as source.  If this
        indicates that the command was executed or invalid, the buffer
        is reset; otherwise, the command is incomplete, and the buffer
        is left as it was after the line was appended.  The return
        value is 1 if more input is required, 0 if the line was dealt
        with in some way (this is the same as runsource()).

        Write a prompt and read a line.

        The returned line does not include the trailing newline.
        When the user enters the EOF key sequence, EOFError is raised.

        The base implementation uses the built-in function
        input(); a subclass may replace this with a different
        implementation.

        readfuncClosely emulate the interactive Python interpreter.

    This is a backwards compatible interface to the InteractiveConsole
    class.  When readfunc is not specified, it attempts to import the
    readline module to enable GNU readline if it is available.

    Arguments (all optional, all default to None):

    banner -- passed to InteractiveConsole.interact()
    readfunc -- if not None, replaces InteractiveConsole.raw_input()
    local -- passed to InteractiveInterpreter.__init__()
    exitmsg -- passed to InteractiveConsole.interact()

        The set of allowed values can be extended via register_error.

     Encodes the object input and returns a tuple (output
            object, length consumed).

            errors defines the error handling to apply. It defaults to
            'strict' handling.

            The method may not store state in the Codec instance. Use
            StreamWriter for codecs which have to keep state in order to
            make encoding efficient.

            The encoder must be able to handle zero length input and
            return an empty object of the output object type in this
            situation.

         Decodes the object input and returns a tuple (output
            object, length consumed).

            input must be an object which provides the bf_getreadbuf
            buffer slot. Python strings, buffer objects and memory
            mapped files are examples of objects providing this slot.

            errors defines the error handling to apply. It defaults to
            'strict' handling.

            The method may not store state in the Codec instance. Use
            StreamReader for codecs which have to keep state in order to

            The decoder must be able to handle zero length input and
            return an empty object of the output object type in this
            situation.

        
    An IncrementalEncoder encodes an input in multiple steps. The input can
    be passed piece by piece to the encode() method. The IncrementalEncoder
    remembers the state of the encoding process between calls to encode().
    
        Creates an IncrementalEncoder instance.

        The IncrementalEncoder may use different error handling schemes by
        providing the errors keyword argument. See the module docstring
        for a list of possible values.
        
        Encodes input and returns the resulting object.
        
        Resets the encoder to the initial state.
        
        Return the current state of the encoder.
        
        Set the current state of the encoder. state must have been
        returned by getstate().
        BufferedIncrementalEncoder
    This subclass of IncrementalEncoder can be used as the baseclass for an
    incremental encoder if the encoder must keep some of the output in a
    buffer between calls to encode().
    _buffer_encodeconsumed
    An IncrementalDecoder decodes an input in multiple steps. The input can
    be passed piece by piece to the decode() method. The IncrementalDecoder
    remembers the state of the decoding process between calls to decode().
    
        Create an IncrementalDecoder instance.

        The IncrementalDecoder may use different error handling schemes by
        providing the errors keyword argument. See the module docstring
        for a list of possible values.
        
        Decode input and returns the resulting object.
        
        Reset the decoder to the initial state.
        
        Return the current state of the decoder.

        This must be a (buffered_input, additional_state_info) tuple.
        buffered_input must be a bytes object containing bytes that
        were passed to decode() that have not yet been converted.
        additional_state_info must be a non-negative integer
        representing the state of the decoder WITHOUT yet having
        processed the contents of buffered_input.  In the initial state
        and after reset(), getstate() must return (b"", 0).
        
        Set the current state of the decoder.

        state must have been returned by getstate().  The effect of
        setstate((b"", 0)) must be equivalent to reset().
        BufferedIncrementalDecoder
    This subclass of IncrementalDecoder can be used as the baseclass for an
    incremental decoder if the decoder must be able to handle incomplete
    byte sequences.
    _buffer_decode Creates a StreamWriter instance.

            stream must be a file-like object open for writing.

            The StreamWriter may use different error handling
            schemes by providing the errors keyword argument. These
            parameters are predefined:

             'strict' - raise a ValueError (or a subclass)
             'ignore' - ignore the character and continue with the next
             'replace'- replace with a suitable replacement character
             'xmlcharrefreplace' - Replace with the appropriate XML
                                   character reference.
             'backslashreplace'  - Replace with backslashed escape
                                   sequences.
             'namereplace'       - Replace with \N{...} escape sequences.

            The set of allowed parameter values can be extended via
            register_error.
         Writes the object's contents encoded to self.stream.
         Writes the concatenated list of strings to the stream
            using .write().
         Flushes and resets the codec buffers used for keeping state.

            Calling this method should ensure that the data on the
            output is put into a clean state, that allows appending
            of new fresh data without having to rescan the whole
            stream to recover state.

         Inherit all other methods from the underlying stream.
        charbuffertype Creates a StreamReader instance.

            stream must be a file-like object open for reading.

            The StreamReader may use different error handling
            schemes by providing the errors keyword argument. These
            parameters are predefined:

             'strict' - raise a ValueError (or a subclass)
             'ignore' - ignore the character and continue with the next
             'replace'- replace with a suitable replacement character
             'backslashreplace' - Replace with backslashed escape sequences;

            The set of allowed parameter values can be extended via
            register_error.
        bytebuffer_empty_charbuffercharbufferlinebufferfirstline Decodes data from the stream self.stream and returns the
            resulting object.

            chars indicates the number of decoded code points or bytes to
            return. read() will never return more data than requested,
            but it might return less, if there is not enough available.

            size indicates the approximate maximum number of decoded
            bytes or code points to read for decoding. The decoder
            can modify this setting as appropriate. The default value
            -1 indicates to read and decode as much as possible.  size
            is intended to prevent having to decode huge files in one
            step.

            If firstline is true, and a UnicodeDecodeError happens
            after the first line terminator in the input only the first line
            will be returned, the rest of the input will be kept until the
            next call to read().

            The method should use a greedy read strategy, meaning that
            it should read as much data as is allowed within the
            definition of the encoding and the given size, e.g.  if
            optional encoding endings or state markers are available
            on the stream, these should be read too.
        newdatanewcharsdecodedbytes Read one line from the input stream and return the
            decoded data.

            size, if given, is passed as size argument to the
            read() method.

        72readsizeline0withendline0withoutend8000sizehint Read all lines available on the input stream
            and return them as a list.

            Line breaks are implemented using the codec's decoder
            method and are included in the list entries.

            sizehint, if given, is ignored since there is no efficient
            way to finding the true end-of-line.

         Resets the codec buffers used for keeping state.

            Note that no stream repositioning should take place.
            This method is primarily intended to be able to recover
            from decoding errors.

         Set the input stream's current position.

            Resets the codec buffers used for keeping state.
         Return the next decoded line from the input stream. StreamReaderWriter instances allow wrapping streams which
        work in both read and write modes.

        The design is such that one can use the factory functions
        returned by the codec.lookup() function to construct the
        instance.

    unknownReaderWriter Creates a StreamReaderWriter instance.

            stream must be a Stream-like object.

            Reader, Writer must be factory functions or classes
            providing the StreamReader, StreamWriter interface resp.

            Error handling is done in the same way as defined for the
            StreamWriter/Readers.

         StreamRecoder instances translate data from one encoding to another.

        They use the complete set of APIs returned by the
        codecs.lookup() function to implement their task.

        Data written to the StreamRecoder is first decoded into an
        intermediate format (depending on the "decode" codec) and then
        written to the underlying stream using an instance of the provided
        Writer class.

        In the other direction, data is read from the underlying stream using
        a Reader instance and then encoded and returned to the caller.

    data_encodingfile_encoding Creates a StreamRecoder instance which implements a two-way
            conversion: encode and decode work on the frontend (the
            data visible to .read() and .write()) while Reader and Writer
            work on the backend (the data in stream).

            You can use these objects to do transparent
            transcodings from e.g. latin-1 to utf-8 and back.

            stream must be a file-like object.

            encode and decode must adhere to the Codec interface; Reader and
            Writer must be factory functions or classes providing the
            StreamReader and StreamWriter interfaces resp.

            Error handling is done in the same way as defined for the
            StreamWriter/Readers.

        bytesencodedbytesdecoded Open an encoded file using the given mode and return
        a wrapped version providing transparent encoding/decoding.

        Note: The wrapped version will only accept the object format
        defined by the codecs, i.e. Unicode objects for most builtin
        codecs. Output is also codec dependent and will usually be
        Unicode as well.

        Underlying encoded files are always opened in binary mode.
        The default file mode is 'r', meaning to open the file in read mode.

        encoding specifies the encoding which is to be used for the
        file.

        errors may be given to define the error handling. It defaults
        to 'strict' which causes ValueErrors to be raised in case an
        encoding error occurs.

        buffering has the same meaning as for the builtin open() API.
        It defaults to -1 which means that the default buffer size will
        be used.

        The returned wrapped file object provides an extra attribute
        .encoding which allows querying the used encoding. This
        attribute is only available if an encoding was specified as
        parameter.

    srw Return a wrapped version of file which provides transparent
        encoding translation.

        Data written to the wrapped file is decoded according
        to the given data_encoding and then encoded to the underlying
        file using file_encoding. The intermediate data type
        will usually be Unicode but depends on the specified codecs.

        Bytes read from the file are decoded using file_encoding and then
        passed back to the caller encoded using data_encoding.

        If file_encoding is not given, it defaults to data_encoding.

        errors may be given to define the error handling. It defaults
        to 'strict' which causes ValueErrors to be raised in case an
        encoding error occurs.

        The returned wrapped file object provides two extra attributes
        .data_encoding and .file_encoding which reflect the given
        parameters of the same name. The attributes can be used for
        introspection by Python programs.

    data_infofile_infosr Lookup up the codec for the given encoding and return
        its encoder function.

        Raises a LookupError in case the encoding cannot be found.

     Lookup up the codec for the given encoding and return
        its decoder function.

        Raises a LookupError in case the encoding cannot be found.

     Lookup up the codec for the given encoding and return
        its IncrementalEncoder class or factory function.

        Raises a LookupError in case the encoding cannot be found
        or the codecs doesn't provide an incremental encoder.

     Lookup up the codec for the given encoding and return
        its IncrementalDecoder class or factory function.

        Raises a LookupError in case the encoding cannot be found
        or the codecs doesn't provide an incremental decoder.

     Lookup up the codec for the given encoding and return
        its StreamReader class or factory function.

        Raises a LookupError in case the encoding cannot be found.

     Lookup up the codec for the given encoding and return
        its StreamWriter class or factory function.

        Raises a LookupError in case the encoding cannot be found.

    
    Encoding iterator.

    Encodes the input strings from the iterator using an IncrementalEncoder.

    errors and kwargs are passed through to the IncrementalEncoder
    constructor.
    
    Decoding iterator.

    Decodes the input strings from the iterator using an IncrementalDecoder.

    errors and kwargs are passed through to the IncrementalDecoder
    constructor.
    make_identity_dictrng make_identity_dict(rng) -> dict

        Return a dictionary where elements of the rng sequence are
        mapped to themselves.

    make_encoding_mapdecoding_map Creates an encoding map from a decoding map.

        If a target mapping in the decoding map occurs multiple
        times, then that target is mapped to None (undefined mapping),
        causing an exception when encountered by the charmap codec
        during translation.

        One example where this happens is cp875.py which decodes
        multiple character to \u001a.

            StreamReader for codecs which have to keep state in order to
            make decoding efficient.

            The decoder must be able to handle zero length input and
            return an empty object of the output object type in this
            situation.

            is intended to prevent having to decode huge files in one
            step.

            If firstline is true, and a UnicodeDecodeError happens

        They use the complete set of APIs returned by the
        codecs.lookup() function to implement their task.

        Data written to the StreamRecoder is first decoded into an
        intermediate format (depending on the "decode" codec) and then
        written to the underlying stream using an instance of the provided
        Writer class.

        In the other direction, data is read from the underlying stream using
        a Reader instance and then encoded and returned to the caller.

        codecs. Output is also codec dependent and will usually be
        Unicode as well.

        Underlying encoded files are always opened in binary mode.

    'b'backslashreplace'u'backslashreplace'b'namereplace'u'namereplace'u'codecs'Utilities to compile possibly incomplete Python source code.

This module provides two interfaces, broadly similar to the builtin
function compile(), which take program text, a filename and a 'mode'
and:

- Return code object if the command is complete and valid
- Return None if the command is incomplete
- Raise SyntaxError, ValueError or OverflowError if the command is a
  syntax error (OverflowError and ValueError can be produced by
  malformed literals).

Approach:

First, check if the source consists entirely of blank lines and
comments; if so, replace it with 'pass', because the built-in
parser doesn't always do the right thing for these.

Compile three times: as is, with \n, and with \n\n appended.  If it
compiles as is, it's complete.  If it compiles with one \n appended,
we expect more.  If it doesn't compile either way, we compare the
error we get when compiling with \n or \n\n appended.  If the errors
are the same, the code is broken.  But if the errors are different, we
expect more.  Not intuitive; not even guaranteed to hold in future
releases; but this matches the compiler's behavior from Python 1.4
through 2.2, at least.

Caveat:

It is possible (but not likely) that the parser stops parsing with a
successful outcome before reaching the end of the source; in this
case, trailing symbols may be ignored instead of causing an error.
For example, a backslash followed by two newlines may be followed by
arbitrary garbage.  This will be fixed once the API for the parser is
better.

The two interfaces are:

    the instance 'remembers' and compiles all subsequent program texts
    with the statement in force.

A configuration file consists of sections, lead by a "[section]" header,
and followed by "name: value" entries, with continuations and such in
the style of RFC 822.

Intrinsic defaults can be specified by passing them into the
ConfigParser constructor as a dictionary.

class:

ConfigParser -- responsible for parsing a list of
                    configuration files, and managing the parsed database.

    methods:

    __init__(defaults=None, dict_type=_default_dict, allow_no_value=False,
             delimiters=('=', ':'), comment_prefixes=('#', ';'),
             inline_comment_prefixes=None, strict=True,
             empty_lines_in_values=True, default_section='DEFAULT',
             interpolation=<unset>, converters=<unset>):
        Create the parser. When `defaults' is given, it is initialized into the
        dictionary or intrinsic defaults. The keys must be strings, the values
        must be appropriate for %()s string interpolation.

        When `dict_type' is given, it will be used to create the dictionary
        objects for the list of sections, for the options within a section, and
        for the default values.

        When `delimiters' is given, it will be used as the set of substrings
        that divide keys from values.

        When `comment_prefixes' is given, it will be used as the set of
        substrings that prefix comments in empty lines. Comments can be
        indented.

        When `inline_comment_prefixes' is given, it will be used as the set of
        substrings that prefix comments in non-empty lines.

        When `strict` is True, the parser won't allow for any section or option
        duplicates while reading from a single source (file, string or
        dictionary). Default is True.

        When `empty_lines_in_values' is False (default: True), each empty line
        marks the end of an option. Otherwise, internal empty lines of
        a multiline option are kept as part of the value.

        When `allow_no_value' is True (default: False), options without
        values are accepted; the value presented for these is None.

        When `default_section' is given, the name of the special section is
        named accordingly. By default it is called ``"DEFAULT"`` but this can
        be customized to point to any other valid section name. Its current
        value can be retrieved using the ``parser_instance.default_section``
        attribute and may be modified at runtime.

        When `interpolation` is given, it should be an Interpolation subclass
        instance. It will be used as the handler for option value
        pre-processing when using getters. RawConfigParser objects don't do
        any sort of interpolation, whereas ConfigParser uses an instance of
        BasicInterpolation. The library also provides a ``zc.buildbot``
        inspired ExtendedInterpolation implementation.

        When `converters` is given, it should be a dictionary where each key
        represents the name of a type converter and each value is a callable
        implementing the conversion from string to the desired datatype. Every
        converter gets its corresponding get*() method on the parser object and
        section proxies.

    sections()
        Return all the configuration section names, sans DEFAULT.

    has_section(section)
        Return whether the given section exists.

    has_option(section, option)
        Return whether the given option exists in the given section.

    options(section)
        Return list of configuration options for the named section.

    read(filenames, encoding=None)
        Read and parse the iterable of named configuration files, given by
        name.  A single filename is also allowed.  Non-existing files
        are ignored.  Return list of successfully read files.

    read_file(f, filename=None)
        Read and parse one configuration file, given as a file object.
        The filename defaults to f.name; it is only used in error
        messages (if f has no `name' attribute, the string `<???>' is used).

    read_string(string)
        Read configuration from a given string.

    read_dict(dictionary)
        Read configuration from a dictionary. Keys are section names,
        values are dictionaries with keys and values that should be present
        in the section. If the used dictionary type preserves order, sections
        and their keys will be added in order. Values are automatically
        converted to strings.

    get(section, option, raw=False, vars=None, fallback=_UNSET)
        Return a string value for the named option.  All % interpolations are
        expanded in the return values, based on the defaults passed into the
        constructor and the DEFAULT section.  Additional substitutions may be
        provided using the `vars' argument, which must be a dictionary whose
        contents override any pre-existing defaults. If `option' is a key in
        `vars', the value from `vars' is used.

    getint(section, options, raw=False, vars=None, fallback=_UNSET)
        Like get(), but convert value to an integer.

    getfloat(section, options, raw=False, vars=None, fallback=_UNSET)
        Like get(), but convert value to a float.

    getboolean(section, options, raw=False, vars=None, fallback=_UNSET)
        Like get(), but convert value to a boolean (currently case
        insensitively defined as 0, false, no, off for False, and 1, true,
        yes, on for True).  Returns False or True.

    items(section=_UNSET, raw=False, vars=None)
        If section is given, return a list of tuples with (name, value) for
        each option in the section. Otherwise, return a list of tuples with
        (section_name, section_proxy) for each section, including DEFAULTSECT.

    remove_section(section)
        Remove the given file section and all its options.

    remove_option(section, option)
        Remove the given option from the given section.

    set(section, option, value)
        Set the given option.

    write(fp, space_around_delimiters=True)
        Write the configuration state in .ini format. If
        `space_around_delimiters' is True (the default), delimiters
        between keys and values are surrounded by spaces.

A configuration file consists of sections, lead by a "[section]" header,
and followed by "name: value" entries, with continuations and such in
the style of RFC 822.

Intrinsic defaults can be specified by passing them into the
ConfigParser constructor as a dictionary.

class:

ConfigParser -- responsible for parsing a list of
                    configuration files, and managing the parsed database.

    methods:

    __init__(defaults=None, dict_type=_default_dict, allow_no_value=False,
             delimiters=('=', ':'), comment_prefixes=('#', ';'),
             inline_comment_prefixes=None, strict=True,
             empty_lines_in_values=True, default_section='DEFAULT',
             interpolation=<unset>, converters=<unset>):
        Create the parser. When `defaults' is given, it is initialized into the
        dictionary or intrinsic defaults. The keys must be strings, the values
        must be appropriate for %()s string interpolation.

        When `dict_type' is given, it will be used to create the dictionary
        objects for the list of sections, for the options within a section, and
        for the default values.

        When `delimiters' is given, it will be used as the set of substrings
        that divide keys from values.

        When `comment_prefixes' is given, it will be used as the set of
        substrings that prefix comments in empty lines. Comments can be
        indented.

        When `inline_comment_prefixes' is given, it will be used as the set of
        substrings that prefix comments in non-empty lines.

        When `strict` is True, the parser won't allow for any section or option
        duplicates while reading from a single source (file, string or
        dictionary). Default is True.

        When `empty_lines_in_values' is False (default: True), each empty line
        marks the end of an option. Otherwise, internal empty lines of
        a multiline option are kept as part of the value.

        When `allow_no_value' is True (default: False), options without
        values are accepted; the value presented for these is None.

        When `default_section' is given, the name of the special section is
        named accordingly. By default it is called ``"DEFAULT"`` but this can
        be customized to point to any other valid section name. Its current
        value can be retrieved using the ``parser_instance.default_section``
        attribute and may be modified at runtime.

        When `interpolation` is given, it should be an Interpolation subclass
        instance. It will be used as the handler for option value
        pre-processing when using getters. RawConfigParser objects don't do
        any sort of interpolation, whereas ConfigParser uses an instance of
        BasicInterpolation. The library also provides a ``zc.buildbot``
        inspired ExtendedInterpolation implementation.

        When `converters` is given, it should be a dictionary where each key
        represents the name of a type converter and each value is a callable
        implementing the conversion from string to the desired datatype. Every
        converter gets its corresponding get*() method on the parser object and
        section proxies.

    sections()
        Return all the configuration section names, sans DEFAULT.

    has_section(section)
        Return whether the given section exists.

    has_option(section, option)
        Return whether the given option exists in the given section.

    options(section)
        Return list of configuration options for the named section.

    read(filenames, encoding=None)
        Read and parse the iterable of named configuration files, given by
        name.  A single filename is also allowed.  Non-existing files
        are ignored.  Return list of successfully read files.

    read_file(f, filename=None)
        Read and parse one configuration file, given as a file object.
        The filename defaults to f.name; it is only used in error
        messages (if f has no `name' attribute, the string `<???>' is used).

    read_string(string)
        Read configuration from a given string.

    read_dict(dictionary)
        Read configuration from a dictionary. Keys are section names,
        values are dictionaries with keys and values that should be present
        in the section. If the used dictionary type preserves order, sections
        and their keys will be added in order. Values are automatically
        converted to strings.

    get(section, option, raw=False, vars=None, fallback=_UNSET)
        Return a string value for the named option.  All % interpolations are
        expanded in the return values, based on the defaults passed into the
        constructor and the DEFAULT section.  Additional substitutions may be
        provided using the `vars' argument, which must be a dictionary whose
        contents override any pre-existing defaults. If `option' is a key in
        `vars', the value from `vars' is used.

    getint(section, options, raw=False, vars=None, fallback=_UNSET)
        Like get(), but convert value to an integer.

    getfloat(section, options, raw=False, vars=None, fallback=_UNSET)
        Like get(), but convert value to a float.

    getboolean(section, options, raw=False, vars=None, fallback=_UNSET)
        Like get(), but convert value to a boolean (currently case
        insensitively defined as 0, false, no, off for False, and 1, true,
        yes, on for True).  Returns False or True.

    items(section=_UNSET, raw=False, vars=None)
        If section is given, return a list of tuples with (name, value) for
        each option in the section. Otherwise, return a list of tuples with
        (section_name, section_proxy) for each section, including DEFAULTSECT.

    remove_section(section)
        Remove the given file section and all its options.

    remove_option(section, option)
        Remove the given option from the given section.

    set(section, option, value)
        Set the given option.

    write(fp, space_around_delimiters=True)
        Write the configuration state in .ini format. If
        `space_around_delimiters' is True (the default), delimiters
        between keys and values are surrounded by spaces.

    backwards-compatibility layer between older and newer Pythons.

    Additional keyword parameters are used to configure attributes of the connection.
    Accepted parameters include:

    - ``strict``: See the documentation on :class:`urllib3.connectionpool.HTTPConnectionPool`
    - ``source_address``: Set the source address for the current connection.
    - ``socket_options``: Set specific options on the underlying socket. If not specified, then
      defaults are loaded from ``HTTPConnection.default_socket_options`` which includes disabling
      Nagle's algorithm (sets TCP_NODELAY to 1) unless the connection is behind a proxy.

      For example, if you wish to enable TCP Keep Alive in addition to the defaults,
      you might pass:

      .. code-block:: python

    default_socket_optionsis_verifiedproxy_is_verifiedsocket_optionsproxy_config
        Getter method to remove any trailing dots that indicate the hostname is an FQDN.

        In general, SSL certificates don't include the trailing dot indicating a
        fully-qualified domain name, and thus, they don't validate properly when
        checked against a domain name that includes the dot. In addition, some
        servers may not expect to receive the trailing dot when provided.

        However, the hostname with trailing dot is critical to DNS resolution; doing a
        lookup with the trailing dot will properly only resolve the appropriate FQDN,
        whereas a lookup without a trailing dot will search the system's search domain
        list. Thus, it's important to keep the original host around for use only in
        those cases where it's appropriate (i.e., when doing DNS lookup to establish the
        actual TCP connection across which we're going to send HTTP requests).

    Base class for all connection pools, such as
    :class:`.HTTPConnectionPool` and :class:`.HTTPSConnectionPool`.

       ConnectionPool.urlopen() does not normalize or percent-encode target URIs
       which is useful if your target server doesn't support percent-encoded
       target URIs.

        EAGAINEWOULDBLOCK_blocking_errnos
    Thread-safe connection pool for one host.

    :param host:
        Host used for this HTTP Connection (e.g. "localhost"), passed into
        :class:`http.client.HTTPConnection`.

    :param port:
        Port used for this HTTP Connection (None is equivalent to 80), passed
        into :class:`http.client.HTTPConnection`.

    :param strict:
        Causes BadStatusLine to be raised if the status line can't be parsed
        as a valid HTTP/1.0 or 1.1 status line, passed into
        :class:`http.client.HTTPConnection`.

        .. note::
           Only works in Python 2. This parameter is ignored in Python 3.

    :param timeout:
        Socket timeout in seconds for each individual connection. This can
        be a float or integer, which sets the timeout for the HTTP request,
        or an instance of :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout` which gives you more
        fine-grained control over request timeouts. After the constructor has
        been parsed, this is always a `urllib3.util.Timeout` object.

    :param maxsize:
        Number of connections to save that can be reused. More than 1 is useful
        in multithreaded situations. If ``block`` is set to False, more
        connections will be created but they will not be saved once they've
        been used.

    :param block:
        If set to True, no more than ``maxsize`` connections will be used at
        a time. When no free connections are available, the call will block
        until a connection has been released. This is a useful side effect for
        particular multithreaded situations where one does not want to use more
        than maxsize connections per host to prevent flooding.

    :param headers:
        Headers to include with all requests, unless other headers are given
        explicitly.

    :param retries:
        Retry configuration to use by default with requests in this pool.

    :param _proxy:
        Parsed proxy URL, should not be used directly, instead, see
        :class:`urllib3.ProxyManager`

    :param _proxy_headers:
        A dictionary with proxy headers, should not be used directly,
        instead, see :class:`urllib3.ProxyManager`

    :param \**conn_kw:
        Additional parameters are used to create fresh :class:`urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection`,
        :class:`urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection` instances.
    ConnectionClsResponseClsDEFAULT_TIMEOUT_proxy_headers_proxy_configconn_kwnum_connectionsnum_requests
        Return a fresh :class:`HTTPConnection`.
        Starting new HTTP connection (%d): %s:%sconnect_timeout
        Get a connection. Will return a pooled connection if one is available.

        If no connections are available and :prop:`.block` is ``False``, then a
        fresh connection is returned.

        :param timeout:
            Seconds to wait before giving up and raising
            :class:`urllib3.exceptions.EmptyPoolError` if the pool is empty and
            :prop:`.block` is ``True``.
        Pool is closed.Pool reached maximum size and no more connections are allowed.Resetting dropped connection: %s_put_conn
        Put a connection back into the pool.

        :param conn:
            Connection object for the current host and port as returned by
            :meth:`._new_conn` or :meth:`._get_conn`.

        If the pool is already full, the connection is closed and discarded
        because we exceeded maxsize. If connections are discarded frequently,
        then maxsize should be increased.

        If the pool is closed, then the connection will be closed and discarded.
        FullConnection pool is full, discarding connection: %s. Connection pool size: %s_validate_conn
        Called right before a request is made, after the socket is created.

        :param conn:
            a connection from one of our connection pools

        :param timeout:
            Socket timeout in seconds for the request. This can be a
            float or integer, which will set the same timeout value for
            the socket connect and the socket read, or an instance of
            :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout`, which gives you more fine-grained
            control over your timeouts.

        pool_timeoutrelease_connbody_posresponse_kw
        Get a connection from the pool and perform an HTTP request. This is the
        lowest level call for making a request, so you'll need to specify all
        the raw details.

        .. note::

           More commonly, it's appropriate to use a convenience method provided
           by :class:`.RequestMethods`, such as :meth:`request`.

        .. note::

           `release_conn` will only behave as expected if
           `preload_content=False` because we want to make
           `preload_content=False` the default behaviour someday soon without
           breaking backwards compatibility.

        :param method:
            HTTP request method (such as GET, POST, PUT, etc.)

        :param url:
            The URL to perform the request on.

        :param body:
            Data to send in the request body, either :class:`str`, :class:`bytes`,
            an iterable of :class:`str`/:class:`bytes`, or a file-like object.

        :param headers:
            Dictionary of custom headers to send, such as User-Agent,
            If-None-Match, etc. If None, pool headers are used. If provided,
            these headers completely replace any pool-specific headers.

        :param retries:
            Configure the number of retries to allow before raising a
            :class:`~urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError` exception.

            Pass ``None`` to retry until you receive a response. Pass a
            :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry` object for fine-grained control
            over different types of retries.
            Pass an integer number to retry connection errors that many times,
            but no other types of errors. Pass zero to never retry.

            If ``False``, then retries are disabled and any exception is raised
            immediately. Also, instead of raising a MaxRetryError on redirects,
            the redirect response will be returned.

        :type retries: :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry`, False, or an int.

        :param redirect:
            If True, automatically handle redirects (status codes 301, 302,
            303, 307, 308). Each redirect counts as a retry. Disabling retries
            will disable redirect, too.

        :param assert_same_host:
            If ``True``, will make sure that the host of the pool requests is
            consistent else will raise HostChangedError. When ``False``, you can
            use the pool on an HTTP proxy and request foreign hosts.

        :param timeout:
            If specified, overrides the default timeout for this one
            request. It may be a float (in seconds) or an instance of
            :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout`.

        :param pool_timeout:
            If set and the pool is set to block=True, then this method will
            block for ``pool_timeout`` seconds and raise EmptyPoolError if no
            connection is available within the time period.

        :param release_conn:
            If False, then the urlopen call will not release the connection
            back into the pool once a response is received (but will release if
            you read the entire contents of the response such as when
            `preload_content=True`). This is useful if you're not preloading
            the response's content immediately. You will need to call
            ``r.release_conn()`` on the response ``r`` to return the connection
            back into the pool. If None, it takes the value of
            ``response_kw.get('preload_content', True)``.

        :param chunked:
            If True, urllib3 will send the body using chunked transfer
            encoding. Otherwise, urllib3 will send the body using the standard
            content-length form. Defaults to False.

        :param int body_pos:
            Position to seek to in file-like body in the event of a retry or
            redirect. Typically this won't need to be set because urllib3 will
            auto-populate the value when needed.

        :param \**response_kw:

    Same as :class:`.HTTPConnectionPool`, but HTTPS.

    :class:`.HTTPSConnection` uses one of ``assert_fingerprint``,
    ``assert_hostname`` and ``host`` in this order to verify connections.
    If ``assert_hostname`` is False, no verification is done.

    The ``key_file``, ``cert_file``, ``cert_reqs``, ``ca_certs``,
    ``ca_cert_dir``, ``ssl_version``, ``key_password`` are only used if :mod:`ssl`
    is available and are fed into :meth:`urllib3.util.ssl_wrap_socket` to upgrade
    the connection socket into an SSL socket.
    
        Prepare the ``connection`` for :meth:`urllib3.util.ssl_wrap_socket`
        and establish the tunnel if proxy is used.
        
        Establishes a tunnel connection through HTTP CONNECT.

    Given a url, return an :class:`.ConnectionPool` instance of its host.

    This is a shortcut for not having to parse out the scheme, host, and port
    of the url before creating an :class:`.ConnectionPool` instance.

    :param url:
        Absolute URL string that must include the scheme. Port is optional.

    :param \**kw:
        Passes additional parameters to the constructor of the appropriate
        :class:`.ConnectionPool`. Useful for specifying things like
        timeout, maxsize, headers, etc.

    Example::

        >>> conn = connection_from_url('http://google.com/')
        >>> r = conn.request('GET', '/')

        than maxsize connections per host to prevent flooding.

    :param headers:
        Headers to include with all requests, unless other headers are given
        explicitly.

    :param retries:
        Retry configuration to use by default with requests in this pool.

    :param _proxy:
        Parsed proxy URL, should not be used directly, instead, see
        :class:`urllib3.ProxyManager`

    :param _proxy_headers:
        A dictionary with proxy headers, should not be used directly,
        instead, see :class:`urllib3.ProxyManager`

    :param \**conn_kw:
        Additional parameters are used to create fresh :class:`urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection`,
        :class:`urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection` instances.
    'u'
    Thread-safe connection pool for one host.

    :param host:
        Host used for this HTTP Connection (e.g. "localhost"), passed into
        :class:`http.client.HTTPConnection`.

    :param port:
        Port used for this HTTP Connection (None is equivalent to 80), passed
        into :class:`http.client.HTTPConnection`.

    :param strict:
        Causes BadStatusLine to be raised if the status line can't be parsed
        as a valid HTTP/1.0 or 1.1 status line, passed into
        :class:`http.client.HTTPConnection`.

        .. note::
           Only works in Python 2. This parameter is ignored in Python 3.

    :param timeout:
        Socket timeout in seconds for each individual connection. This can
        be a float or integer, which sets the timeout for the HTTP request,
        or an instance of :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout` which gives you more
        fine-grained control over request timeouts. After the constructor has
        been parsed, this is always a `urllib3.util.Timeout` object.

    :param maxsize:
        Number of connections to save that can be reused. More than 1 is useful
        in multithreaded situations. If ``block`` is set to False, more
        connections will be created but they will not be saved once they've
        been used.

    :param block:
        If set to True, no more than ``maxsize`` connections will be used at
        a time. When no free connections are available, the call will block
        until a connection has been released. This is a useful side effect for
        particular multithreaded situations where one does not want to use more
        than maxsize connections per host to prevent flooding.

    :param headers:
        Headers to include with all requests, unless other headers are given
        explicitly.

    :param retries:
        Retry configuration to use by default with requests in this pool.

    :param _proxy:
        Parsed proxy URL, should not be used directly, instead, see
        :class:`urllib3.ProxyManager`

    :param _proxy_headers:
        A dictionary with proxy headers, should not be used directly,
        instead, see :class:`urllib3.ProxyManager`

    :param \**conn_kw:
        Additional parameters are used to create fresh :class:`urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection`,
        :class:`urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection` instances.
    'b'
        Return a fresh :class:`HTTPConnection`.

        Get a connection. Will return a pooled connection if one is available.

        If no connections are available and :prop:`.block` is ``False``, then a
        fresh connection is returned.

        :param timeout:
            Seconds to wait before giving up and raising
            :class:`urllib3.exceptions.EmptyPoolError` if the pool is empty and
            :prop:`.block` is ``True``.
        'u'
        Get a connection. Will return a pooled connection if one is available.

        If no connections are available and :prop:`.block` is ``False``, then a
        fresh connection is returned.

        :param timeout:
            Seconds to wait before giving up and raising
            :class:`urllib3.exceptions.EmptyPoolError` if the pool is empty and
            :prop:`.block` is ``True``.

        Put a connection back into the pool.

        :param conn:
            Connection object for the current host and port as returned by
            :meth:`._new_conn` or :meth:`._get_conn`.

        If the pool is already full, the connection is closed and discarded
        because we exceeded maxsize. If connections are discarded frequently,
        then maxsize should be increased.

        If the pool is closed, then the connection will be closed and discarded.
        'u'
        Put a connection back into the pool.

        :param conn:
            Connection object for the current host and port as returned by

        :param conn:
            a connection from one of our connection pools

        :param timeout:
            Socket timeout in seconds for the request. This can be a
            float or integer, which will set the same timeout value for
            the socket connect and the socket read, or an instance of
            :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout`, which gives you more fine-grained
            control over your timeouts.
        'u'

        'u'
        Check if the given ``url`` is a member of the same host as this
        connection pool.
        'b'
        Get a connection from the pool and perform an HTTP request. This is the
        lowest level call for making a request, so you'll need to specify all
        the raw details.

        .. note::

           More commonly, it's appropriate to use a convenience method provided
           by :class:`.RequestMethods`, such as :meth:`request`.

        .. note::

           `release_conn` will only behave as expected if
           `preload_content=False` because we want to make
           `preload_content=False` the default behaviour someday soon without
           breaking backwards compatibility.

        :param method:
            HTTP request method (such as GET, POST, PUT, etc.)

        :param url:
            The URL to perform the request on.

        :param body:
            Data to send in the request body, either :class:`str`, :class:`bytes`,
            an iterable of :class:`str`/:class:`bytes`, or a file-like object.

        :param headers:
            Dictionary of custom headers to send, such as User-Agent,
            If-None-Match, etc. If None, pool headers are used. If provided,
            these headers completely replace any pool-specific headers.

        :param retries:
            Configure the number of retries to allow before raising a
            :class:`~urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError` exception.

            Pass ``None`` to retry until you receive a response. Pass a
            :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry` object for fine-grained control
            over different types of retries.
            Pass an integer number to retry connection errors that many times,
            but no other types of errors. Pass zero to never retry.

            If ``False``, then retries are disabled and any exception is raised
            immediately. Also, instead of raising a MaxRetryError on redirects,
            the redirect response will be returned.

        :type retries: :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry`, False, or an int.

        :param redirect:
            If True, automatically handle redirects (status codes 301, 302,
            303, 307, 308). Each redirect counts as a retry. Disabling retries
            will disable redirect, too.

        :param assert_same_host:
            If ``True``, will make sure that the host of the pool requests is
            consistent else will raise HostChangedError. When ``False``, you can
            use the pool on an HTTP proxy and request foreign hosts.

        :param timeout:
            If specified, overrides the default timeout for this one
            request. It may be a float (in seconds) or an instance of
            :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout`.

        :param pool_timeout:
            If set and the pool is set to block=True, then this method will
            block for ``pool_timeout`` seconds and raise EmptyPoolError if no
            connection is available within the time period.

        :param release_conn:
            If False, then the urlopen call will not release the connection
            back into the pool once a response is received (but will release if
            you read the entire contents of the response such as when
            `preload_content=True`). This is useful if you're not preloading
            the response's content immediately. You will need to call
            ``r.release_conn()`` on the response ``r`` to return the connection
            back into the pool. If None, it takes the value of
            ``response_kw.get('preload_content', True)``.

        :param chunked:
            If True, urllib3 will send the body using chunked transfer
            encoding. Otherwise, urllib3 will send the body using the standard
            content-length form. Defaults to False.

        :param int body_pos:
            Position to seek to in file-like body in the event of a retry or
            redirect. Typically this won't need to be set because urllib3 will
            auto-populate the value when needed.

        :param \**response_kw:
            Additional parameters are passed to
            :meth:`urllib3.response.HTTPResponse.from_httplib`
        'u'
        Get a connection from the pool and perform an HTTP request. This is the
        lowest level call for making a request, so you'll need to specify all
        the raw details.

            :class:`~urllib3.util.retry.Retry` object for fine-grained control
            over different types of retries.
            Pass an integer number to retry connection errors that many times,

            :class:`urllib3.util.Timeout`.

        :param pool_timeout:
            If set and the pool is set to block=True, then this method will
            block for ``pool_timeout`` seconds and raise EmptyPoolError if no
            connection is available within the time period.

        :param release_conn:
            If False, then the urlopen call will not release the connection

This module has (now fairly distant) origins in Gisle Aas' Perl module

Docstrings, comments and debug strings in this code refer to the
attributes of the HTTP cookie system as cookie-attributes, to distinguish
them clearly from Python attributes.

    Return value is an integer.

    None is returned if the format of str is unrecognized, the time is outside
    the representable range, or the timezone string is not recognized.  If the
    string contains no timezone, UTC is assumed.

    The timezone in the string may be numerical (like "-0800" or "+0100") or a
    string timezone (like "UTC", "GMT", "BST" or "EST").  Currently, only the
    timezone strings equivalent to UTC (zero offset) are known to the function.

    The function loosely parses the following formats:

    Wed, 09 Feb 1994 22:23:32 GMT       -- HTTP format
    Tuesday, 08-Feb-94 14:15:29 GMT     -- old rfc850 HTTP format

    08-Feb-1994 14:15:29 GMT            -- broken rfc850 format (no weekday)

    The parser ignores leading and trailing whitespace.  The time may be
    absent.

    If the year is given with only 2 digits, the function will select the
    century that makes the year closest to the current date.

    The function knows how to deal with ",", ";" and "=" as well as quoted
    values after "=".  A list of space separated tokens are parsed as if they
    were separated by ";".

    If the header_values passed as argument contains multiple values, then they
    are treated as if they were a single value separated by comma ",".

    This means that this function is useful for parsing header fields that
    follow this syntax (BNF as from the HTTP/1.1 specification, but we relax
    the requirement for tokens).

      headers           = #header
      header            = (token | parameter) *( [";"] (token | parameter))

      token             = 1*<any CHAR except CTLs or separators>

      parameter         = attribute "=" value
      attribute         = token
      value             = token | quoted-string

    Each header is represented by a list of key/value pairs.  The value for a
    simple token (not part of a parameter) is None.  Syntactically incorrect
    headers will not necessarily be parsed as you would want.

    This is easier to describe with some examples:

    >>> split_header_words(['foo="bar"; port="80,81"; discard, bar=baz'])
    [[('foo', 'bar'), ('port', '80,81'), ('discard', None)], [('bar', 'baz')]]
    >>> split_header_words(['text/html; charset="iso-8859-1"'])
    [[('text/html', None), ('charset', 'iso-8859-1')]]

    value.  Attribute values are quoted if needed.

    The old Netscape cookie format for Set-Cookie can for instance contain
    an unquoted "," in the expires field, so we have to use this ad-hoc
    parser instead of split_header_words.

    XXX This may not make the best possible effort to parse all the crap
    that Netscape Cookie headers contain.  Ronald Tschalar's HTTPClient
    parser is probably better, so could do worse than following that if
    this ever gives any trouble.

    This class represents both Netscape and RFC 2965 cookies.

    This is deliberately a very simple class.  It just holds attributes.  It's
    possible to construct Cookie instances that don't comply with the cookie
    standards.  CookieJar.make_cookies is the factory function for Cookie
    objects -- it deals with cookie parsing, supplying defaults, and
    normalising to the representation used in this class.  CookiePolicy is
    responsible for checking them to see whether they should be accepted from
    and returned to the server.

    Note that the port may be present in the headers, but unspecified ("Port"
    rather than"Port=80", for example); if this is the case, port is None.

        removed.  If given two arguments, cookies belonging to the specified
        path within that domain are removed.  If given three arguments, then
        the cookie with the specified name, path and domain is removed.

        Raises KeyError if no matching cookie exists.

        Discard all expired cookies.

        You probably don't need to call this method: expired cookies are never
        sent back to the server (provided you're using DefaultCookiePolicy),
        this method is called by CookieJar itself every so often, and the
        .save() method won't save expired cookies anyway (unless you ask
        otherwise by passing a true ignore_expires argument).

    The LWPCookieJar saves a sequence of "Set-Cookie3" lines.
    "Set-Cookie3" is the format used by the libwww-perl library, not known
    to be compatible with any browser, but which is easy to read and
    doesn't lose information about RFC 2965 cookies.

    WARNING: you may want to backup your browser's cookies file if you use
    this class to save cookies.  I *think* it works, but there have been
    bugs in the past!

    This class differs from CookieJar only in the format it uses to save and
    load cookies to and from a file.  This class uses the Mozilla/Netscape
    `cookies.txt' format.  lynx uses this file format, too.

    Don't expect cookies saved while the browser is running to be noticed by
    the browser (in fact, Mozilla on unix will overwrite your saved cookies if
    you change them on disk while it's running; on Windows, you probably can't
    save at all while the browser is running).

    Note that the Mozilla/Netscape format will downgrade RFC2965 cookies to
    Netscape cookies on saving.

    In particular, the cookie version and port number information is lost,
    together with information about whether or not Path, Port and Discard were
    specified by the Set-Cookie2 (or Set-Cookie) header, and whether or not the
    domain as set in the HTTP header started with a dot (yes, I'm aware some
    domains in Netscape files start with a dot and some don't -- trust me, you
    really don't want to know any more about this).

    Note that though Mozilla and Netscape use the same format, they use
    slightly different headers.  The class saves cookies using the Netscape
    header by default (Mozilla can cope with that).

    Return value is an integer.

    None is returned if the format of str is unrecognized, the time is outside
    the representable range, or the timezone string is not recognized.  If the
    string contains no timezone, UTC is assumed.

    The timezone in the string may be numerical (like "-0800" or "+0100") or a
    string timezone (like "UTC", "GMT", "BST" or "EST").  Currently, only the
    timezone strings equivalent to UTC (zero offset) are known to the function.

    The function loosely parses the following formats:

    Wed, 09 Feb 1994 22:23:32 GMT       -- HTTP format
    Tuesday, 08-Feb-94 14:15:29 GMT     -- old rfc850 HTTP format

    08-Feb-1994 14:15:29 GMT            -- broken rfc850 format (no weekday)

    The parser ignores leading and trailing whitespace.  The time may be
    absent.

    If the year is given with only 2 digits, the function will select the
    century that makes the year closest to the current date.

    'u'Returns time in seconds since epoch of time represented by a string.

    The function knows how to deal with ",", ";" and "=" as well as quoted

    If the header_values passed as argument contains multiple values, then they
    are treated as if they were a single value separated by comma ",".

    This means that this function is useful for parsing header fields that
    follow this syntax (BNF as from the HTTP/1.1 specification, but we relax
    the requirement for tokens).

    Each header is represented by a list of key/value pairs.  The value for a
    simple token (not part of a parameter) is None.  Syntactically incorrect

    WARNING: you may want to backup your browser's cookies file if you use
    this class to save cookies.  I *think* it works, but there have been
    bugs in the past!

    This class differs from CookieJar only in the format it uses to save and
    load cookies to and from a file.  This class uses the Mozilla/Netscape
    `cookies.txt' format.  lynx uses this file format, too.

    Don't expect cookies saved while the browser is running to be noticed by
    the browser (in fact, Mozilla on unix will overwrite your saved cookies if
    you change them on disk while it's running; on Windows, you probably can't
    save at all while the browser is running).

    Note that the Mozilla/Netscape format will downgrade RFC2965 cookies to
    Netscape cookies on saving.

    In particular, the cookie version and port number information is lost,
    together with information about whether or not Path, Port and Discard were
    specified by the Set-Cookie2 (or Set-Cookie) header, and whether or not the
    domain as set in the HTTP header started with a dot (yes, I'm aware some
    domains in Netscape files start with a dot and some don't -- trust me, you
    really don't want to know any more about this).

    Note that though Mozilla and Netscape use the same format, they use
    slightly different headers.  The class saves cookies using the Netscape
    header by default (Mozilla can cope with that).

Here's a sample session to show how to use this module.
At the moment, this is the only documentation.

The Basics
----------

Importing is easy...

   >>> from http import cookies

Most of the time you start by creating a cookie.

   >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()

Once you've created your Cookie, you can add values just as if it were
a dictionary.

   >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()
   >>> C["fig"] = "newton"
   >>> C["sugar"] = "wafer"
   >>> C.output()
   'Set-Cookie: fig=newton\r\nSet-Cookie: sugar=wafer'

Notice that the printable representation of a Cookie is the
appropriate format for a Set-Cookie: header.  This is the
default behavior.  You can change the header and printed
attributes by using the .output() function

   >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()
   >>> C["rocky"] = "road"
   >>> C["rocky"]["path"] = "/cookie"
   >>> print(C.output(header="Cookie:"))
   Cookie: rocky=road; Path=/cookie
   >>> print(C.output(attrs=[], header="Cookie:"))
   Cookie: rocky=road

The load() method of a Cookie extracts cookies from a string.  In a
CGI script, you would use this method to extract the cookies from the
HTTP_COOKIE environment variable.

   >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()
   >>> C.load("chips=ahoy; vienna=finger")
   >>> C.output()
   'Set-Cookie: chips=ahoy\r\nSet-Cookie: vienna=finger'

The load() method is darn-tootin smart about identifying cookies
within a string.  Escaped quotation marks, nested semicolons, and other
such trickeries do not confuse it.

   >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()
   >>> C.load('keebler="E=everybody; L=\\"Loves\\"; fudge=\\012;";')
   >>> print(C)
   Set-Cookie: keebler="E=everybody; L=\"Loves\"; fudge=\012;"

Each element of the Cookie also supports all of the RFC 2109
Cookie attributes.  Here's an example which sets the Path
attribute.

   >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()
   >>> C["oreo"] = "doublestuff"
   >>> C["oreo"]["path"] = "/"
   >>> print(C)
   Set-Cookie: oreo=doublestuff; Path=/

Each dictionary element has a 'value' attribute, which gives you
back the value associated with the key.

   >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()
   >>> C["twix"] = "none for you"
   >>> C["twix"].value
   'none for you'

The SimpleCookie expects that all values should be standard strings.
Just to be sure, SimpleCookie invokes the str() builtin to convert
the value to a string, when the values are set dictionary-style.

   >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()
   >>> C["number"] = 7
   >>> C["string"] = "seven"
   >>> C["number"].value
   '7'
   >>> C["string"].value
   'seven'
   >>> C.output()
   'Set-Cookie: number=7\r\nSet-Cookie: string=seven'

   >>> C["fig"] = "newton"
   >>> C["sugar"] = "wafer"

Notice that the printable representation of a Cookie is the

default behavior.  You can change the header and printed
attributes by using the .output() function

   >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()
   >>> C["rocky"] = "road"
   >>> C["rocky"]["path"] = "/cookie"
   >>> print(C.output(header="Cookie:"))
   Cookie: rocky=road; Path=/cookie
   >>> print(C.output(attrs=[], header="Cookie:"))
   Cookie: rocky=road

The load() method of a Cookie extracts cookies from a string.  In a
CGI script, you would use this method to extract the cookies from the
HTTP_COOKIE environment variable.

   >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()
   >>> C.load("chips=ahoy; vienna=finger")

The load() method is darn-tootin smart about identifying cookies
within a string.  Escaped quotation marks, nested semicolons, and other
such trickeries do not confuse it.

   >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()
   >>> C.load('keebler="E=everybody; L=\\"Loves\\"; fudge=\\012;";')
   >>> print(C)
   Set-Cookie: keebler="E=everybody; L=\"Loves\"; fudge=\012;"

Each element of the Cookie also supports all of the RFC 2109
Cookie attributes.  Here's an example which sets the Path
attribute.

   >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()
   >>> C["oreo"] = "doublestuff"
   >>> C["oreo"]["path"] = "/"
   >>> print(C)
   Set-Cookie: oreo=doublestuff; Path=/

Each dictionary element has a 'value' attribute, which gives you
back the value associated with the key.

   >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()
   >>> C["twix"] = "none for you"
   >>> C["twix"].value
   'none for you'

The SimpleCookie expects that all values should be standard strings.
Just to be sure, SimpleCookie invokes the str() builtin to convert
the value to a string, when the values are set dictionary-style.

   >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()
   >>> C["number"] = 7
   >>> C["string"] = "seven"
   >>> C["number"].value
   '7'
   >>> C["string"].value
   'seven'
   >>> C.output()
   'Set-Cookie: number=7\r\nSet-Cookie: string=seven'

Here's a sample session to show how to use this module.
At the moment, this is the only documentation.

The Basics
----------

Importing is easy...

   >>> from http import cookies

Most of the time you start by creating a cookie.

   >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()

Once you've created your Cookie, you can add values just as if it were
a dictionary.

   >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()
   >>> C["fig"] = "newton"
   >>> C["sugar"] = "wafer"
   >>> C.output()
   'Set-Cookie: fig=newton\r\nSet-Cookie: sugar=wafer'

Notice that the printable representation of a Cookie is the
appropriate format for a Set-Cookie: header.  This is the
default behavior.  You can change the header and printed
attributes by using the .output() function

   >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()
   >>> C["rocky"] = "road"
   >>> C["rocky"]["path"] = "/cookie"
   >>> print(C.output(header="Cookie:"))
   Cookie: rocky=road; Path=/cookie
   >>> print(C.output(attrs=[], header="Cookie:"))
   Cookie: rocky=road

The load() method of a Cookie extracts cookies from a string.  In a
CGI script, you would use this method to extract the cookies from the
HTTP_COOKIE environment variable.

   >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()
   >>> C.load("chips=ahoy; vienna=finger")
   >>> C.output()
   'Set-Cookie: chips=ahoy\r\nSet-Cookie: vienna=finger'

The load() method is darn-tootin smart about identifying cookies
within a string.  Escaped quotation marks, nested semicolons, and other
such trickeries do not confuse it.

   >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()
   >>> C.load('keebler="E=everybody; L=\\"Loves\\"; fudge=\\012;";')
   >>> print(C)
   Set-Cookie: keebler="E=everybody; L=\"Loves\"; fudge=\012;"

Each element of the Cookie also supports all of the RFC 2109
Cookie attributes.  Here's an example which sets the Path
attribute.

   >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()
   >>> C["oreo"] = "doublestuff"
   >>> C["oreo"]["path"] = "/"
   >>> print(C)
   Set-Cookie: oreo=doublestuff; Path=/

Each dictionary element has a 'value' attribute, which gives you
back the value associated with the key.

   >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()
   >>> C["twix"] = "none for you"
   >>> C["twix"].value
   'none for you'

The SimpleCookie expects that all values should be standard strings.
Just to be sure, SimpleCookie invokes the str() builtin to convert
the value to a string, when the values are set dictionary-style.

   >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()
   >>> C["number"] = 7
   >>> C["string"] = "seven"
   >>> C["number"].value
   '7'
   >>> C["string"].value
   'seven'
   >>> C.output()
   'Set-Cookie: number=7\r\nSet-Cookie: string=seven'

Compatibility code to be able to use `cookielib.CookieJar` with requests.

requests.utils imports from here, so be careful with imports.
dummy_threadingMockRequestWraps a `requests.Request` to mimic a `urllib2.Request`.

    The code in `cookielib.CookieJar` expects this interface in order to correctly
    manage cookie policies, i.e., determine whether a cookie can be set, given the
    domains of the request and the cookie.

    The original request object is read-only. The client is responsible for collecting
    the new headers via `get_new_headers()` and interpreting them appropriately. You
    probably want `get_cookie_header`, defined below.

    Use .get and .set and include domain and path args in order to be more specific.
    RequestsCookieJarCompatibility class; is a cookielib.CookieJar, but exposes a dict
    interface.

    This is the CookieJar we create by default for requests and sessions that
    don't specify one, since some clients may expect response.cookies and
    session.cookies to support dict operations.

    Requests does not use the dict interface internally; it's just for
    compatibility with external client code. All requests code should work
    out of the box with externally provided instances of ``CookieJar``, e.g.
    ``LWPCookieJar`` and ``FileCookieJar``.

    Unlike a regular CookieJar, this class is pickleable.

    .. warning:: dictionary operations that are normally O(1) may be O(n).

Interface summary:

        import copy

        x = copy.copy(y)        # make a shallow copy of y
        x = copy.deepcopy(y)    # make a deep copy of y

For module specific errors, copy.Error is raised.

The difference between shallow and deep copying is only relevant for
compound objects (objects that contain other objects, like lists or
class instances).

- A shallow copy constructs a new compound object and then (to the
  extent possible) inserts *the same objects* into it that the
  original contains.

- A deep copy constructs a new compound object and then, recursively,
  inserts *copies* into it of the objects found in the original.

Two problems often exist with deep copy operations that don't exist
with shallow copy operations:

 a) recursive objects (compound objects that, directly or indirectly,
    contain a reference to themselves) may cause a recursive loop

 b) because deep copy copies *everything* it may copy too much, e.g.
    administrative data structures that should be shared even between
    copies

Python's deep copy operation avoids these problems by:

 a) keeping a table of objects already copied during the current
    copying pass

 b) letting user-defined classes override the copying operation or the
    set of components copied

This version does not copy types like module, class, function, method,
nor stack trace, stack frame, nor file, socket, window, nor array, nor
any similar types.

Classes can use the same interfaces to control copying that they use
to control pickling: they can define methods called __getinitargs__(),
__getstate__() and __setstate__().  See the documentation for module

The only module that needs to be imported to use the Distutils; provides
the 'setup' function (which is to be called from the setup script).  Also
indirectly provides the Distribution and Command classes, although they are
really defined in distutils.dist and distutils.cmd.

    to do, in a highly flexible and user-driven way.  Briefly: create a
    Distribution instance; find and parse config files; parse the command
    line; run each Distutils command found there, customized by the options
    supplied to 'setup()' (as keyword arguments), in config files, and on
    the command line.

    The Distribution instance might be an instance of a class supplied via
    the 'distclass' keyword argument to 'setup'; if no such class is
    supplied, then the Distribution class (in dist.py) is instantiated.
    All other arguments to 'setup' (except for 'cmdclass') are used to set
    attributes of the Distribution instance.

    The 'cmdclass' argument, if supplied, is a dictionary mapping command
    names to command classes.  Each command encountered on the command line
    will be turned into a command class, which is in turn instantiated; any
    class found in 'cmdclass' is used in place of the default, which is
    (for command 'foo_bar') class 'foo_bar' in module
    'distutils.command.foo_bar'.  The command class must provide a
    'user_options' attribute which is a list of option specifiers for
    'distutils.fancy_getopt'.  Any command-line options between the current
    and the next command are used to set attributes of the current command
    object.

    When the entire command-line has been successfully parsed, calls the
    'run()' method on each command object in turn.  This method will be
    driven entirely by the Distribution object (which each command object
    has a reference to, thanks to its constructor), and the
    command-specific options that became attributes of each command
    object.

        For example:
                         ,'some text',
        The quote with the most wins, same with the delimiter.

        The delimiter /should/ occur the same number of times on
        each row. However, due to malformed data, it may not. We don't want
        an all or nothing approach, so we allow for small variations in this
        number.
          1) build a table of the frequency of each character on every line.
          2) build a table of frequencies of this frequency (meta-frequency?),
             e.g.  'x occurred 5 times in 10 rows, 6 times in 1000 rows,
             7 times in 2 rows'
          3) use the mode of the meta-frequency to determine the /expected/
             frequency for that character
          4) find out how often the character actually meets that goal
          5) the character that best meets its goal is the delimiter
        For performance reasons, the data is evaluated in chunks, so it can

        The delimiter /should/ occur the same number of times on
        each row. However, due to malformed data, it may not. We don't want
        an all or nothing approach, so we allow for small variations in this
        number.
          1) build a table of the frequency of each character on every line.
          2) build a table of frequencies of this frequency (meta-frequency?),
             e.g.  'x occurred 5 times in 10 rows, 6 times in 1000 rows,
             7 times in 2 rows'
          3) use the mode of the meta-frequency to determine the /expected/
             frequency for that character
          4) find out how often the character actually meets that goal
          5) the character that best meets its goal is the delimiter
        For performance reasons, the data is evaluated in chunks, so it can
        try and evaluate the smallest portion of the data possible, evaluating
        additional chunks as necessary.

    When the ratio is exactly half-way between two integers,
    the even integer is returned.
    greater_than_halfRepresent the difference between two datetime objects.

    Supported operators:

    - add, subtract timedelta
    - unary plus, minus, abs
    - compare to timedelta
    - multiply, divide by int

    In addition, datetime supports subtraction of two datetime objects
    returning a timedelta, and addition or subtraction of a datetime
    and a timedelta giving a datetime.

If x and y have the same tzinfo member, x.s = y.s.#    This is actually a requirement, an assumption we need to make about#    sane tzinfo classes.# 3. The naive UTC time corresponding to x is x.n - x.o.#    This is again a requirement for a sane tzinfo class.# 4. (x+k).s = x.s#    This follows from #2, and that datetime.timetz+timedelta preserves tzinfo.# 5. (x+k).n = x.n + k#    Again follows from how arithmetic is defined.# Now we can explain tz.fromutc(x).  Let's assume it's an interesting case# (meaning that the various tzinfo methods exist, and don't blow up or return# None when called).# The function wants to return a datetime y with timezone tz, equivalent to x.# x is already in UTC.# By #3, we want#     y.n - y.o = x.n                             [1]# The algorithm starts by attaching tz to x.n, and calling that y.  So# x.n = y.n at the start.  Then it wants to add a duration k to y, so that [1]# becomes true; in effect, we want to solve [2] for k:#    (y+k).n - (y+k).o = x.n                      [2]# By #1, this is the same as#    (y+k).n - ((y+k).s + (y+k).d) = x.n          [3]# By #5, (y+k).n = y.n + k, which equals x.n + k because x.n=y.n at the start.# Substituting that into [3],#    x.n + k - (y+k).s - (y+k).d = x.n; the x.n terms cancel, leaving#    k - (y+k).s - (y+k).d = 0; rearranging,#    k = (y+k).s - (y+k).d; by #4, (y+k).s == y.s, so#    k = y.s - (y+k).d# On the RHS, (y+k).d can't be computed directly, but y.s can be, and we# approximate k by ignoring the (y+k).d term at first.  Note that k can't be# very large, since all offset-returning methods return a duration of magnitude# less than 24 hours.  For that reason, if y is firmly in std time, (y+k).d must# be 0, so ignoring it has no consequence then.# In any case, the new value is#     z = y + y.s                                 [4]# It's helpful to step back at look at [4] from a higher level:  it's simply# mapping from UTC to tz's standard time.# At this point, if#     z.n - z.o = x.n                             [5]# we have an equivalent time, and are almost done.  The insecurity here is# at the start of daylight time.  Picture US Eastern for concreteness.  The wall# time jumps from 1:59 to 3:00, and wall hours of the form 2:MM don't make good# sense then.  The docs ask that an Eastern tzinfo class consider such a time to# be EDT (because it's "after 2"), which is a redundant spelling of 1:MM EST# on the day DST starts.  We want to return the 1:MM EST spelling because that's# the only spelling that makes sense on the local wall clock.# In fact, if [5] holds at this point, we do have the standard-time spelling,# but that takes a bit of proof.  We first prove a stronger result.  What's the# difference between the LHS and RHS of [5]?  Let#     diff = x.n - (z.n - z.o)                    [6]# Now#     z.n =                       by [4]#     (y + y.s).n =               by #5#     y.n + y.s =                 since y.n = x.n#     x.n + y.s =                 since z and y are have the same tzinfo member,#                                     y.s = z.s by #2#     x.n + z.s# Plugging that back into [6] gives#     diff =#     x.n - ((x.n + z.s) - z.o) =     expanding#     x.n - x.n - z.s + z.o =         cancelling#     - z.s + z.o =                   by #2#     z.d# So diff = z.d.# If [5] is true now, diff = 0, so z.d = 0 too, and we have the standard-time# spelling we wanted in the endcase described above.  We're done.  Contrarily,# if z.d = 0, then we have a UTC equivalent, and are also done.# If [5] is not true now, diff = z.d != 0, and z.d is the offset we need to# add to z (in effect, z is in tz's standard time, and we need to shift the# local clock into tz's daylight time).# Let#     z' = z + z.d = z + diff                     [7]# and we can again ask whether#     z'.n - z'.o = x.n                           [8]# If so, we're done.  If not, the tzinfo class is insane, according to the# assumptions we've made.  This also requires a bit of proof.  As before, let's# compute the difference between the LHS and RHS of [8] (and skipping some of# the justifications for the kinds of substitutions we've done several times# already):#     diff' = x.n - (z'.n - z'.o) =           replacing z'.n via [7]#             x.n  - (z.n + diff - z'.o) =    replacing diff via [6]#             x.n - (z.n + x.n - (z.n - z.o) - z'.o) =#             x.n - z.n - x.n + z.n - z.o + z'.o =    cancel x.n#             - z.n + z.n - z.o + z'.o =              cancel z.n#             - z.o + z'.o =                      #1 twice#             -z.s - z.d + z'.s + z'.d =          z and z' have same tzinfo#             z'.d - z.d# So z' is UTC-equivalent to x iff z'.d = z.d at this point.  If they are equal,# we've found the UTC-equivalent so are done.  In fact, we stop with [7] and# return z', not bothering to compute z'.d.# How could z.d and z'd differ?  z' = z + z.d [7], so merely moving z' by# a dst() offset, and starting *from* a time already in DST (we know z.d != 0),# would have to change the result dst() returns:  we start in DST, and moving# a little further into it takes us out of DST.# There isn't a sane case where this can happen.  The closest it gets is at# the end of DST, where there's an hour in UTC with no spelling in a hybrid# tzinfo class.  In US Eastern, that's 5:MM UTC = 0:MM EST = 1:MM EDT.  During# that hour, on an Eastern clock 1:MM is taken as being in standard time (6:MM# UTC) because the docs insist on that, but 0:MM is taken as being in daylight# time (4:MM UTC).  There is no local time mapping to 5:MM UTC.  The local# clock jumps from 1:59 back to 1:00 again, and repeats the 1:MM hour in# standard time.  Since that's what the local clock *does*, we want to map both# UTC hours 5:MM and 6:MM to 1:MM Eastern.  The result is ambiguous# in local time, but so it goes -- it's the way the local clock works.# When x = 5:MM UTC is the input to this algorithm, x.o=0, y.o=-5 and y.d=0,# so z=0:MM.  z.d=60 (minutes) then, so [5] doesn't hold and we keep going.# z' = z + z.d = 1:MM then, and z'.d=0, and z'.d - z.d = -60 != 0 so [8]# (correctly) concludes that z' is not UTC-equivalent to x.# Because we know z.d said z was in daylight time (else [5] would have held and# we would have stopped then), and we know z.d != z'.d (else [8] would have held# and we have stopped then), and there are only 2 possible values dst() can# return in Eastern, it follows that z'.d must be 0 (which it is in the example,# but the reasoning doesn't depend on the example -- it depends on there being# two possible dst() outcomes, one zero and the other non-zero).  Therefore# z' must be in standard time, and is the spelling we want in this case.# Note again that z' is not UTC-equivalent as far as the hybrid tzinfo class is# concerned (because it takes z' as being in standard time rather than the# daylight time we intend here), but returning it gives the real-life "local# clock repeats an hour" behavior when mapping the "unspellable" UTC hour into# tz.# When the input is 6:MM, z=1:MM and z.d=0, and we stop at once, again with# the 1:MM standard time spelling we want.# So how can this break?  One of the assumptions must be violated.  Two# possibilities:# 1) [2] effectively says that y.s is invariant across all y belong to a given#    time zone.  This isn't true if, for political reasons or continental drift,#    a region decides to change its base offset from UTC.# 2) There may be versions of "double daylight" time where the tail end of#    the analysis gives up a step too early.  I haven't thought about that#    enough to say.# In any case, it's clear that the default fromutc() is strong enough to handle# "almost all" time zones:  so long as the standard offset is invariant, it# doesn't matter if daylight time transition points change from year to year, or# if daylight time is skipped in some years; it doesn't matter how large or# small dst() may get within its bounds; and it doesn't even matter if some# perverse time zone returns a negative dst()).  So a breaking case must be# pretty bizarre, and a tzinfo subclass can override fromutc() if it is.# Clean up unused names# XXX Since import * above excludes names that start with _,# docstring does not get overwritten.

    It also understands ``NaN``, ``Infinity``, and ``-Infinity`` as
    their corresponding ``float`` values, which is outside the JSON spec.

    ``object_hook``, if specified, will be called with the result
        of every JSON object decoded and its return value will be used in
        place of the given ``dict``.  This can be used to provide custom
        deserializations (e.g. to support JSON-RPC class hinting).

        ``object_pairs_hook``, if specified will be called with the result of
        every JSON object decoded with an ordered list of pairs.  The return
        value of ``object_pairs_hook`` will be used instead of the ``dict``.
        This feature can be used to implement custom decoders.
        If ``object_hook`` is also defined, the ``object_pairs_hook`` takes
        priority.

        ``parse_float``, if specified, will be called with the string
        of every JSON float to be decoded. By default this is equivalent to
        float(num_str). This can be used to use another datatype or parser
        for JSON floats (e.g. decimal.Decimal).

        ``parse_int``, if specified, will be called with the string
        of every JSON int to be decoded. By default this is equivalent to
        int(num_str). This can be used to use another datatype or parser
        for JSON integers (e.g. float).

        ``parse_constant``, if specified, will be called with one of the
        following strings: -Infinity, Infinity, NaN.
        This can be used to raise an exception if invalid JSON numbers
        are encountered.

        If ``strict`` is false (true is the default), then control
        characters will be allowed inside strings.  Control characters in
        this context are those with character codes in the 0-31 range,
        including ``'\t'`` (tab), ``'\n'``, ``'\r'`` and ``'\0'``.

        This can be used to decode a JSON document from a string that may
        have extraneous data at the end.

    'b'``object_hook``, if specified, will be called with the result
        of every JSON object decoded and its return value will be used in
        place of the given ``dict``.  This can be used to provide custom
        deserializations (e.g. to support JSON-RPC class hinting).

        ``object_pairs_hook``, if specified will be called with the result of
        every JSON object decoded with an ordered list of pairs.  The return
        value of ``object_pairs_hook`` will be used instead of the ``dict``.
        This feature can be used to implement custom decoders.
        If ``object_hook`` is also defined, the ``object_pairs_hook`` takes
        priority.

        ``parse_float``, if specified, will be called with the string
        of every JSON float to be decoded. By default this is equivalent to
        float(num_str). This can be used to use another datatype or parser
        for JSON floats (e.g. decimal.Decimal).

        ``parse_int``, if specified, will be called with the string
        of every JSON int to be decoded. By default this is equivalent to
        int(num_str). This can be used to use another datatype or parser
        for JSON integers (e.g. float).

        ``parse_constant``, if specified, will be called with one of the
        following strings: -Infinity, Infinity, NaN.
        This can be used to raise an exception if invalid JSON numbers
        are encountered.

        If ``strict`` is false (true is the default), then control
        characters will be allowed inside strings.  Control characters in
        this context are those with character codes in the 0-31 range,

    SequenceMatcher is a flexible class for comparing pairs of sequences of
    any type, so long as the sequence elements are hashable.  The basic
    algorithm predates, and is a little fancier than, an algorithm
    published in the late 1980's by Ratcliff and Obershelp under the
    hyperbolic name "gestalt pattern matching".  The basic idea is to find
    the longest contiguous matching subsequence that contains no "junk"
    elements (R-O doesn't address junk).  The same idea is then applied
    recursively to the pieces of the sequences to the left and to the right
    of the matching subsequence.  This does not yield minimal edit
    sequences, but does tend to yield matches that "look right" to people.

    SequenceMatcher tries to compute a "human-friendly diff" between two
    sequences.  Unlike e.g. UNIX(tm) diff, the fundamental notion is the
    longest *contiguous* & junk-free matching subsequence.  That's what
    catches peoples' eyes.  The Windows(tm) windiff has another interesting
    notion, pairing up elements that appear uniquely in each sequence.
    That, and the method here, appear to yield more intuitive difference
    reports than does diff.  This method appears to be the least vulnerable
    to synching up on blocks of "junk lines", though (like blank lines in
    ordinary text files, or maybe "<P>" lines in HTML files).  That may be
    because this is the only method of the 3 that has a *concept* of
    "junk" <wink>.

    Example, comparing two strings, and considering blanks to be "junk":

    >>> s = SequenceMatcher(lambda x: x == " ",
    ...                     "private Thread currentThread;",
    ...                     "private volatile Thread currentThread;")
    >>>

    .ratio() returns a float in [0, 1], measuring the "similarity" of the
    sequences.  As a rule of thumb, a .ratio() value over 0.6 means the
    sequences are close matches:

    >>> print(round(s.ratio(), 3))
    0.866
    >>>

    If you're only interested in where the sequences match,
    .get_matching_blocks() is handy:

    >>> for block in s.get_matching_blocks():
    ...     print("a[%d] and b[%d] match for %d elements" % block)
    a[0] and b[0] match for 8 elements
    a[8] and b[17] match for 21 elements
    a[29] and b[38] match for 0 elements

    Note that the last tuple returned by .get_matching_blocks() is always a
    dummy, (len(a), len(b), 0), and this is the only case in which the last
    tuple element (number of elements matched) is 0.

    If you want to know how to change the first sequence into the second,
    use .get_opcodes():

    >>> for opcode in s.get_opcodes():
    ...     print("%6s a[%d:%d] b[%d:%d]" % opcode)
     equal a[0:8] b[0:8]
    insert a[8:8] b[8:17]
     equal a[8:29] b[17:38]

    See the Differ class for a fancy human-friendly file differencer, which
    uses SequenceMatcher both to compare sequences of lines, and to compare
    sequences of characters within similar (near-matching) lines.

    See also function get_close_matches() in this module, which shows how
    simple code building on SequenceMatcher can be used to do useful work.

    Timing:  Basic R-O is cubic time worst case and quadratic time expected
    case.  SequenceMatcher is quadratic time for the worst case and has
    expected-case behavior dependent in a complicated way on how many
    elements the sequences have in common; best case time is linear.

    Methods:

    __init__(isjunk=None, a='', b='')
        Construct a SequenceMatcher.

    set_seqs(a, b)
        Set the two sequences to be compared.

    set_seq1(a)
        Set the first sequence to be compared.

    set_seq2(b)
        Set the second sequence to be compared.

    find_longest_match(alo, ahi, blo, bhi)
        Find longest matching block in a[alo:ahi] and b[blo:bhi].

    get_matching_blocks()
        Return list of triples describing matching subsequences.

    get_opcodes()
        Return list of 5-tuples describing how to turn a into b.

    ratio()
        Return a measure of the sequences' similarity (float in [0,1]).

    quick_ratio()
        Return an upper bound on .ratio() relatively quickly.

    real_quick_ratio()
        Return an upper bound on ratio() very quickly.
    isjunkautojunkConstruct a SequenceMatcher.

        Optional arg isjunk is None (the default), or a one-argument
        function that takes a sequence element and returns true iff the
        element is junk.  None is equivalent to passing "lambda x: 0", i.e.
        no elements are considered to be junk.  For example, pass
            lambda x: x in " \t"
        if you're comparing lines as sequences of characters, and don't
        want to synch up on blanks or hard tabs.

        Optional arg a is the first of two sequences to be compared.  By
        default, an empty string.  The elements of a must be hashable.  See
        also .set_seqs() and .set_seq1().

        Optional arg b is the second of two sequences to be compared.  By
        default, an empty string.  The elements of b must be hashable. See
        also .set_seqs() and .set_seq2().

        Optional arg autojunk should be set to False to disable the
        "automatic junk heuristic" that treats popular elements as junk
        (see module documentation for more information).
        set_seqsSet the two sequences to be compared.

        >>> s = SequenceMatcher()
        >>> s.set_seqs("abcd", "bcde")
        >>> s.ratio()
        0.75
        set_seq1set_seq2Set the first sequence to be compared.

        The second sequence to be compared is not changed.

        >>> s = SequenceMatcher(None, "abcd", "bcde")
        >>> s.ratio()
        0.75
        >>> s.set_seq1("bcde")
        >>> s.ratio()
        1.0
        >>>

        SequenceMatcher computes and caches detailed information about the
        second sequence, so if you want to compare one sequence S against
        many sequences, use .set_seq2(S) once and call .set_seq1(x)
        repeatedly for each of the other sequences.

        See also set_seqs() and set_seq2().

        Match(a=0, b=4, size=5)

        If isjunk is defined, first the longest matching block is
        determined as above, but with the additional restriction that no
        junk element appears in the block.  Then that block is extended as
        far as possible by matching (only) junk elements on both sides.  So
        the resulting block never matches on junk except as identical junk
        happens to be adjacent to an "interesting" match.

        Here's the same example as before, but considering blanks to be
        junk.  That prevents " abcd" from matching the " abcd" at the tail
        end of the second sequence directly.  Instead only the "abcd" can
        match, and matches the leftmost "abcd" in the second sequence:

        >>> s = SequenceMatcher(lambda x: x==" ", " abcd", "abcd abcd")
        >>> s.find_longest_match(0, 5, 0, 9)
        Match(a=1, b=0, size=4)

        If no blocks match, return (alo, blo, 0).

        >>> s = SequenceMatcher(None, "ab", "c")
        >>> s.find_longest_match(0, 2, 0, 1)
        Match(a=0, b=0, size=0)
        isbjunkbestibestjbestsizej2lennothingj2lengetnewj2lenget_matching_blocksReturn list of triples describing matching subsequences.

        Each triple is of the form (i, j, n), and means that
        a[i:i+n] == b[j:j+n].  The triples are monotonically increasing in
        i and in j.  New in Python 2.5, it's also guaranteed that if
        (i, j, n) and (i', j', n') are adjacent triples in the list, and
        the second is not the last triple in the list, then i+n != i' or
        j+n != j'.  IOW, adjacent triples never describe adjacent equal
        blocks.

        The last triple is a dummy, (len(a), len(b), 0), and is the only
        triple with n==0.

        >>> list(s.get_matching_blocks())

        lalbj1k1non_adjacentj2k2get_opcodesReturn list of 5-tuples describing how to turn a into b.

        Each tuple is of the form (tag, i1, i2, j1, j2).  The first tuple
        has i1 == j1 == 0, and remaining tuples have i1 == the i2 from the
        tuple preceding it, and likewise for j1 == the previous j2.

        The tags are strings, with these meanings:

        'replace':  a[i1:i2] should be replaced by b[j1:j2]
        'delete':   a[i1:i2] should be deleted.
                    Note that j1==j2 in this case.
        'insert':   b[j1:j2] should be inserted at a[i1:i1].
                    Note that i1==i2 in this case.
        'equal':    a[i1:i2] == b[j1:j2]

        >>> a = "qabxcd"
        >>> b = "abycdf"
        >>> s = SequenceMatcher(None, a, b)
        >>> for tag, i1, i2, j1, j2 in s.get_opcodes():
        ...    print(("%7s a[%d:%d] (%s) b[%d:%d] (%s)" %
        ...           (tag, i1, i2, a[i1:i2], j1, j2, b[j1:j2])))

         insert a[6:6] () b[5:6] (f)
        answeraibjequalget_grouped_opcodes Isolate change clusters by eliminating ranges with no changes.

        Return a generator of groups with up to n lines of context.
        Each group is in the same format as returned by get_opcodes().

          ('equal', 35, 38, 31, 34)]]
        nnReturn a measure of the sequences' similarity (float in [0,1]).

        Where T is the total number of elements in both sequences, and
        M is the number of matches, this is 2.0*M / T.
        Note that this is 1 if the sequences are identical, and 0 if
        they have nothing in common.

        .ratio() is expensive to compute if you haven't already computed
        .get_matching_blocks() or .get_opcodes(), in which case you may
        want to try .quick_ratio() or .real_quick_ratio() first to get an
        upper bound.

        >>> s = SequenceMatcher(None, "abcd", "bcde")
        >>> s.ratio()
        0.75
        >>> s.quick_ratio()
        0.75
        >>> s.real_quick_ratio()
        1.0
        triplequick_ratioReturn an upper bound on ratio() relatively quickly.

        This isn't defined beyond that it is an upper bound on .ratio(), and
        is faster to compute.
        availavailhasnumbreal_quick_ratioReturn an upper bound on ratio() very quickly.

        This isn't defined beyond that it is an upper bound on .ratio(), and
        is faster to compute than either .ratio() or .quick_ratio().

    word is a sequence for which close matches are desired (typically a
    string).

    possibilities is a list of sequences against which to match word
    (typically a list of strings).

    Optional arg n (default 3) is the maximum number of close matches to
    return.  n must be > 0.

    Optional arg cutoff (default 0.6) is a float in [0, 1].  Possibilities
    that don't score at least that similar to word are ignored.

    The best (no more than n) matches among the possibilities are returned
    in a list, sorted by similarity score, most similar first.

    Differ is a class for comparing sequences of lines of text, and
    producing human-readable differences or deltas.  Differ uses
    SequenceMatcher both to compare sequences of lines, and to compare
    sequences of characters within similar (near-matching) lines.

    Each line of a Differ delta begins with a two-letter code:

        '- '    line unique to sequence 1
        '+ '    line unique to sequence 2
        '  '    line common to both sequences
        '? '    line not present in either input sequence

    Lines beginning with '? ' attempt to guide the eye to intraline
    differences, and were not present in either input sequence.  These lines
    can be confusing if the sequences contain tab characters.

    Note that Differ makes no claim to produce a *minimal* diff.  To the
    contrary, minimal diffs are often counter-intuitive, because they synch
    up anywhere possible, sometimes accidental matches 100 pages apart.
    Restricting synch points to contiguous matches preserves some notion of
    locality, at the occasional cost of producing a longer diff.

    Example: Comparing two texts.

    First we set up the texts, sequences of individual single-line strings
    ending with newlines (such sequences can also be obtained from the
    `readlines()` method of file-like objects):

    >>> text1 = '''  1. Beautiful is better than ugly.
    ...   2. Explicit is better than implicit.
    ...   3. Simple is better than complex.
    ...   4. Complex is better than complicated.
    ... '''.splitlines(keepends=True)
    >>> len(text1)
    4
    >>> text1[0][-1]
    '\n'
    >>> text2 = '''  1. Beautiful is better than ugly.
    ...   3.   Simple is better than complex.
    ...   4. Complicated is better than complex.
    ...   5. Flat is better than nested.
    ... '''.splitlines(keepends=True)

    Next we instantiate a Differ object:

    >>> d = Differ()

    Note that when instantiating a Differ object we may pass functions to
    filter out line and character 'junk'.  See Differ.__init__ for details.

    Finally, we compare the two:

    >>> result = list(d.compare(text1, text2))

    'result' is a list of strings, so let's pretty-print it:

    >>> from pprint import pprint as _pprint
    >>> _pprint(result)
    ['    1. Beautiful is better than ugly.\n',
     '-   2. Explicit is better than implicit.\n',
     '-   3. Simple is better than complex.\n',
     '+   3.   Simple is better than complex.\n',
     '?     ++\n',
     '-   4. Complex is better than complicated.\n',
     '?            ^                     ---- ^\n',
     '+   4. Complicated is better than complex.\n',
     '?           ++++ ^                      ^\n',
     '+   5. Flat is better than nested.\n']

    As a single multi-line string it looks like this:

    >>> print(''.join(result), end="")
        1. Beautiful is better than ugly.
    -   2. Explicit is better than implicit.
    -   3. Simple is better than complex.
    +   3.   Simple is better than complex.
    ?     ++
    -   4. Complex is better than complicated.
    ?            ^                     ---- ^
    +   4. Complicated is better than complex.
    ?           ++++ ^                      ^
    +   5. Flat is better than nested.

    Methods:

    __init__(linejunk=None, charjunk=None)
        Construct a text differencer, with optional filters.

    compare(a, b)
        Compare two sequences of lines; generate the resulting delta.
    linejunkcharjunk
        Construct a text differencer, with optional filters.

        The two optional keyword parameters are for filter functions:

        - `linejunk`: A function that should accept a single string argument,
          and return true iff the string is junk. The module-level function
          `IS_LINE_JUNK` may be used to filter out lines without visible
          characters, except for at most one splat ('#').  It is recommended
          to leave linejunk None; the underlying SequenceMatcher class has
          an adaptive notion of "noise" lines that's better than any static
          definition the author has ever been able to craft.

        - `charjunk`: A function that should accept a string of length 1. The
          module-level function `IS_CHARACTER_JUNK` may be used to filter out
          whitespace characters (a blank or tab; **note**: bad idea to include
          newline in this!).  Use of IS_CHARACTER_JUNK is recommended.
        
        Compare two sequences of lines; generate the resulting delta.

        Each sequence must contain individual single-line strings ending with
        newlines. Such sequences can be obtained from the `readlines()` method
        of file-like objects.  The delta generated also consists of newline-
        terminated strings, ready to be printed as-is via the writeline()
        method of a file-like object.

        Example:

        >>> print(''.join(Differ().compare('one\ntwo\nthree\n'.splitlines(True),
        ...                                'ore\ntree\nemu\n'.splitlines(True))),

        cruncher_fancy_replace_dumpGenerate comparison results for a same-tagged range._plain_replace
        When replacing one block of lines with another, search the blocks
        for *similar* lines; the best-matching pair (if any) is used as a
        synch point, and intraline difference marking is done on the
        similar pair. Lots of work, but often worth it.

        Example:

        >>> d = Differ()
        >>> results = d._fancy_replace(['abcDefghiJkl\n'], 0, 1,
        ...                            ['abcdefGhijkl\n'], 0, 1)
        >>> print(''.join(results), end="")
        - abcDefghiJkl
        ?    ^  ^  ^

        Format "?" output and deal with tabs.

        Example:

        >>> results = d._qformat('\tabcDefghiJkl\n', '\tabcdefGhijkl\n',
        ...                      '  ^ ^  ^      ', '  ^ ^  ^      ')

        '+ \tabcdefGhijkl\n'
        '? \t ^ ^  ^\n'
        - ? + \s*(?:#\s*)?$
    Return True for ignorable line: iff `line` is blank or contains a single '#'.

    Examples:

    >>> IS_LINE_JUNK('\n')
    True
    >>> IS_LINE_JUNK('  #   \n')
    True
    >>> IS_LINE_JUNK('hello\n')
    False
    
    Return True for ignorable character: iff `ch` is a space or tab.

    Examples:

    >>> IS_CHARACTER_JUNK(' ')
    True
    >>> IS_CHARACTER_JUNK('\t')
    True
    >>> IS_CHARACTER_JUNK('\n')
    False
    >>> IS_CHARACTER_JUNK('x')
    False
    _format_range_unifiedConvert range to the "ed" formatbeginning{},{}fromfiledatetofiledatelineterm
    Compare two sequences of lines; generate the delta as a unified diff.

    Unified diffs are a compact way of showing line changes and a few
    lines of context.  The number of context lines is set by 'n' which
    defaults to three.

    By default, the diff control lines (those with ---, +++, or @@) are
    created with a trailing newline.  This is helpful so that inputs
    created from file.readlines() result in diffs that are suitable for
    file.writelines() since both the inputs and outputs have trailing
    newlines.

    For inputs that do not have trailing newlines, set the lineterm
    argument to "" so that the output will be uniformly newline free.

    The unidiff format normally has a header for filenames and modification
    times.  Any or all of these may be specified using strings for
    'fromfile', 'tofile', 'fromfiledate', and 'tofiledate'.
    The modification times are normally expressed in the ISO 8601 format.

    Example:

    >>> for line in unified_diff('one two three four'.split(),
    ...             'zero one tree four'.split(), 'Original', 'Current',
    ...             '2005-01-26 23:30:50', '2010-04-02 10:20:52',

    Compare two sequences of lines; generate the delta as a context diff.

    Context diffs are a compact way of showing line changes and a few
    lines of context.  The number of context lines is set by 'n' which
    defaults to three.

    By default, the diff control lines (those with *** or ---) are
    created with a trailing newline.  This is helpful so that inputs
    created from file.readlines() result in diffs that are suitable for
    file.writelines() since both the inputs and outputs have trailing
    newlines.

    For inputs that do not have trailing newlines, set the lineterm

    strings for 'fromfile', 'tofile', 'fromfiledate', and 'tofiledate'.
    The modification times are normally expressed in the ISO 8601 format.
    If not specified, the strings default to blanks.

    Compare `a` and `b`, two sequences of lines represented as bytes rather
    than str. This is a wrapper for `dfunc`, which is typically either
    unified_diff() or context_diff(). Inputs are losslessly converted to
    strings so that `dfunc` only has to worry about strings, and encoded
    back to bytes on return. This is necessary to compare files with
    unknown or inconsistent encoding. All other inputs (except `n`) must be
    bytes rather than str.
    all arguments must be bytes, not %s (%r)
    Compare `a` and `b` (lists of strings); return a `Differ`-style delta.

    Optional keyword parameters `linejunk` and `charjunk` are for filter
    functions, or can be None:

    - linejunk: A function that should accept a single string argument and
      return true iff the string is junk.  The default is None, and is
      recommended; the underlying SequenceMatcher class has an adaptive
      notion of "noise" lines.

    - charjunk: A function that accepts a character (string of length
      1), and returns true iff the character is junk. The default is
      the module-level function IS_CHARACTER_JUNK, which filters out
      whitespace characters (a blank or tab; note: it's a bad idea to
      include newline in this!).

    Tools/scripts/ndiff.py is a command-line front-end to this function.

    Example:

    _mdifffromlinestolinesReturns generator yielding marked up from/to side by side differences.

    Arguments:
    fromlines -- list of text lines to compared to tolines
    tolines -- list of text lines to be compared to fromlines
    context -- number of context lines to display on each side of difference,
               if None, all from/to text lines will be generated.
    linejunk -- passed on to ndiff (see ndiff documentation)
    charjunk -- passed on to ndiff (see ndiff documentation)

    This function returns an iterator which returns a tuple:
    (from line tuple, to line tuple, boolean flag)

    from/to line tuple -- (line num, line text)
        line num -- integer or None (to indicate a context separation)
        line text -- original line text with following markers inserted:
            '\0+' -- marks start of added text
            '\0-' -- marks start of deleted text
            '\0^' -- marks start of changed text
            '\1' -- marks end of added/deleted/changed text

    boolean flag -- None indicates context separation, True indicates
        either "from" or "to" line contains a change, otherwise False.

    This function/iterator was originally developed to generate side by side
    file difference for making HTML pages (see HtmlDiff class for example
    usage).

    Note, this function utilizes the ndiff function to generate the side by
    side difference markup.  Optional ndiff arguments may be passed to this
    function and they in turn will be passed to ndiff.
    (\++|\-+|\^+)change_rediff_lines_iterator_make_lineformat_keysidenum_linesReturns line of text with user's change markup and line formatting.

        lines -- list of lines from the ndiff generator to produce a line of
                 text from.  When producing the line of text to return, the
                 lines used are removed from this list.
        format_key -- '+' return first line in list with "add" markup around

        num_lines -- from/to current line number.  This is NOT intended to be a
                     passed parameter.  It is present as a keyword argument to
                     maintain memory of the current line numbers between calls
                     of this function.

        Note, this function is purposefully not defined at the module scope so
        that data it needs from its parent function (within whose context it
        is defined) does not need to be of module scope.

        This function is an iterator.  It itself pulls lines from a
        differencing iterator, processes them and yields them.  When it can
        it yields both a "from" and a "to" line, otherwise it will yield one
        or the other.  In addition to yielding the lines of from/to text, a
        boolean flag is yielded to indicate if the text line(s) have
        differences in them.

        that data it needs from its parent function (within whose context it

        This function is an iterator.  It itself pulls lines from the line
        iterator.  Its difference from that iterator is that this function
        always yields a pair of from/to text lines (with the change
        indication).  If necessary it will collect single from/to lines
        until it has a matching pair from/to pair to yield.

    </table>_legendFor producing HTML side by side comparison with change highlights.

    This class can be used to create an HTML table (or a complete HTML file
    containing the table) showing a side by side, line by line comparison
    of text with inter-line and intra-line change highlights.  The table can
    be generated in either full or contextual difference mode.

    The following methods are provided for HTML generation:

    make_table -- generates HTML for a single side by side table
    make_file -- generates complete HTML file with a single side by side table

    See tools/scripts/diff.py for an example usage of this class.
    _default_prefixwrapcolumnHtmlDiff instance initializer

        Arguments:
        tabsize -- tab stop spacing, defaults to 8.
        wrapcolumn -- column number where lines are broken and wrapped,
            defaults to None where lines are not wrapped.
        linejunk,charjunk -- keyword arguments passed into ndiff() (used by
            HtmlDiff() to generate the side by side HTML differences).  See
            ndiff() documentation for argument default values and descriptions.
        _tabsize_wrapcolumn_linejunk_charjunkfromdesctodescnumlinesReturns HTML file of side by side comparison with change highlights

        Arguments:
        fromlines -- list of "from" lines
        tolines -- list of "to" lines
        fromdesc -- "from" file column header string
        todesc -- "to" file column header string
        context -- set to True for contextual differences (defaults to False
            which shows full differences).
        numlines -- number of context lines.  When context is set True,
            controls number of lines displayed before and after the change.
            When context is False, controls the number of lines to place
            the "next" link anchors before the next change (so click of
            "next" link jumps to just before the change).
        charset -- charset of the HTML document
        styleslegendmake_tabletable_tab_newline_replaceReturns from/to line lists with tabs expanded and newlines removed.

        Instead of tab characters being replaced by the number of spaces
        needed to fill in to the next tab stop, this function will fill
        the space with tab characters.  This is done so that the difference
        algorithms can identify changes in a file when tabs are replaced by
        spaces and vice versa.  At the end of the HTML generation, the tab
        characters will be replaced with a nonbreakable space.
        expand_tabs_split_linedata_listBuilds list of text lines by splitting text lines at wrap point

        This function will determine if the input text line needs to be
        wrapped (split) into separate lines.  If so, the first wrap point
        will be determined and the first line appended to the output
        text line list.  This function is used recursively to handle
        the second part of the split line to further split it.
        line1line2_line_wrapperdiffsReturns iterator that splits (wraps) mdiff text linesfromdatatodatafromlinefromtexttolinetotext_collect_linesCollects mdiff output into separate lists

        Before storing the mdiff from/to data into a list, it is converted
        into a single line of text with HTML markup.
        flaglist_format_linelinenumReturns HTML markup of "from" / "to" text lines

        side -- 0 or 1 indicating "from" or "to" text
        flag -- indicates if difference on line
        linenum -- line number (used for line number column)
        text -- line text to be marked up

        todesc -- "to" file column header string
        context -- set to True for contextual differences (defaults to False
            which shows full differences).
        numlines -- number of context lines.  When context is set True,
            controls number of lines displayed before and after the change.

    Generate one of the two sequences that generated a delta.

    Given a `delta` produced by `Differ.compare()` or `ndiff()`, extract
    lines originating from file 1 or 2 (parameter `which`), stripping off line
    prefixes.

    Examples:

    >>> diff = ndiff('one\ntwo\nthree\n'.splitlines(keepends=True),
    ...              'ore\ntree\nemu\n'.splitlines(keepends=True))
    >>> diff = list(diff)
    >>> print(''.join(restore(diff, 1)), end="")
    one
    two
    three
    >>> print(''.join(restore(diff, 2)), end="")

If anyone sees# Jim Roskind, thank him again for profile.py -- I never would# have guessed that.# The first trick is to build b2j ignoring the possibility# of junk.  I.e., we don't call isjunk at all yet.  Throwing# out the junk later is much cheaper than building b2j "right"# from the start.# Purge junk elements# separate loop avoids separate list of keys# Purge popular elements that are not junk# ditto; as fast for 1% deletion# CAUTION:  stripping common prefix or suffix would be incorrect.# E.g.,#    ab#    acab# Longest matching block is "ab", but if common prefix is# stripped, it's "a" (tied with "b").  UNIX(tm) diff does so# strip, so ends up claiming that ab is changed to acab by# inserting "ca" in the middle.  That's minimal but unintuitive:# "it's obvious" that someone inserted "ac" at the front.# Windiff ends up at the same place as diff, but by pairing up# the unique 'b's and then matching the first two 'a's.# find longest junk-free match# during an iteration of the loop, j2len[j] = length of longest# junk-free match ending with a[i-1] and b[j]# look at all instances of a[i] in b; note that because# b2j has no junk keys, the loop is skipped if a[i] is junk# a[i] matches b[j]# Extend the best by non-junk elements on each end.  In particular,# "popular" non-junk elements aren't in b2j, which greatly speeds# the inner loop above, but also means "the best" match so far# doesn't contain any junk *or* popular non-junk elements.# Now that we have a wholly interesting match (albeit possibly# empty!), we may as well suck up the matching junk on each# side of it too.  Can't think of a good reason not to, and it# saves post-processing the (possibly considerable) expense of# figuring out what to do with it.  In the case of an empty# interesting match, this is clearly the right thing to do,# because no other kind of match is possible in the regions.# This is most naturally expressed as a recursive algorithm, but# at least one user bumped into extreme use cases that exceeded# the recursion limit on their box.  So, now we maintain a list# ('queue`) of blocks we still need to look at, and append partial# results to `matching_blocks` in a loop; the matches are sorted# at the end.# a[alo:i] vs b[blo:j] unknown# a[i:i+k] same as b[j:j+k]# a[i+k:ahi] vs b[j+k:bhi] unknown# if k is 0, there was no matching block# It's possible that we have adjacent equal blocks in the# matching_blocks list now.  Starting with 2.5, this code was added# to collapse them.# Is this block adjacent to i1, j1, k1?# Yes, so collapse them -- this just increases the length of# the first block by the length of the second, and the first# block so lengthened remains the block to compare against.# Not adjacent.  Remember the first block (k1==0 means it's# the dummy we started with), and make the second block the# new block to compare against.# invariant:  we've pumped out correct diffs to change# a[:i] into b[:j], and the next matching block is# a[ai:ai+size] == b[bj:bj+size].  So we need to pump# out a diff to change a[i:ai] into b[j:bj], pump out# the matching block, and move (i,j) beyond the match# the list of matching blocks is terminated by a# sentinel with size 0# Fixup leading and trailing groups if they show no changes.# End the current group and start a new one whenever# there is a large range with no changes.# viewing a and b as multisets, set matches to the cardinality# of their intersection; this counts the number of matches# without regard to order, so is clearly an upper bound# avail[x] is the number of times x appears in 'b' less the# number of times we've seen it in 'a' so far ... kinda# can't have more matches than the number of elements in the# shorter sequence# Move the best scorers to head of list# Strip scores for the best n matches# dump the shorter block first -- reduces the burden on short-term# memory if the blocks are of very different sizes# don't synch up unless the lines have a similarity score of at# least cutoff; best_ratio tracks the best score seen so far# 1st indices of equal lines (if any)# search for the pair that matches best without being identical# (identical lines must be junk lines, & we don't want to synch up# on junk -- unless we have to)# computing similarity is expensive, so use the quick# upper bounds first -- have seen this speed up messy# compares by a factor of 3.# note that ratio() is only expensive to compute the first# time it's called on a sequence pair; the expensive part# of the computation is cached by cruncher# no non-identical "pretty close" pair# no identical pair either -- treat it as a straight replace# no close pair, but an identical pair -- synch up on that# there's a close pair, so forget the identical pair (if any)# a[best_i] very similar to b[best_j]; eqi is None iff they're not# identical# pump out diffs from before the synch point# do intraline marking on the synch pair# pump out a '-', '?', '+', '?' quad for the synched lines# the synch pair is identical# pump out diffs from after the synch point# With respect to junk, an earlier version of ndiff simply refused to# *start* a match with a junk element.  The result was cases like this:#     before: private Thread currentThread;#     after:  private volatile Thread currentThread;# If you consider whitespace to be junk, the longest contiguous match# not starting with junk is "e Thread currentThread".  So ndiff reported# that "e volatil" was inserted between the 't' and the 'e' in "private".# While an accurate view, to people that's absurd.  The current version# looks for matching blocks that are entirely junk-free, then extends the# longest one of those as far as possible but only with matching junk.# So now "currentThread" is matched, then extended to suck up the# preceding blank; then "private" is matched, and extended to suck up the# following blank; then "Thread" is matched; and finally ndiff reports# that "volatile " was inserted before "Thread".  The only quibble# remaining is that perhaps it was really the case that " volatile"# was inserted after "private".

    published in the late 1980's by Ratcliff and Obershelp under the
    hyperbolic name "gestalt pattern matching".  The basic idea is to find
    the longest contiguous matching subsequence that contains no "junk"
    elements (R-O doesn't address junk).  The same idea is then applied
    recursively to the pieces of the sequences to the left and to the right
    of the matching subsequence.  This does not yield minimal edit
    sequences, but does tend to yield matches that "look right" to people.

    SequenceMatcher tries to compute a "human-friendly diff" between two
    sequences.  Unlike e.g. UNIX(tm) diff, the fundamental notion is the
    longest *contiguous* & junk-free matching subsequence.  That's what
    catches peoples' eyes.  The Windows(tm) windiff has another interesting
    notion, pairing up elements that appear uniquely in each sequence.
    That, and the method here, appear to yield more intuitive difference
    reports than does diff.  This method appears to be the least vulnerable
    to synching up on blocks of "junk lines", though (like blank lines in
    ordinary text files, or maybe "<P>" lines in HTML files).  That may be
    because this is the only method of the 3 that has a *concept* of
    "junk" <wink>.

    Example, comparing two strings, and considering blanks to be "junk":

    >>> s = SequenceMatcher(lambda x: x == " ",
    ...                     "private Thread currentThread;",
    ...                     "private volatile Thread currentThread;")
    >>>

    .ratio() returns a float in [0, 1], measuring the "similarity" of the
    sequences.  As a rule of thumb, a .ratio() value over 0.6 means the
    sequences are close matches:

    >>> print(round(s.ratio(), 3))
    0.866
    >>>

    If you're only interested in where the sequences match,
    .get_matching_blocks() is handy:

    >>> for block in s.get_matching_blocks():
    ...     print("a[%d] and b[%d] match for %d elements" % block)
    a[0] and b[0] match for 8 elements
    a[8] and b[17] match for 21 elements
    a[29] and b[38] match for 0 elements

    Note that the last tuple returned by .get_matching_blocks() is always a
    dummy, (len(a), len(b), 0), and this is the only case in which the last
    tuple element (number of elements matched) is 0.

    If you want to know how to change the first sequence into the second,
    use .get_opcodes():

    >>> for opcode in s.get_opcodes():
    ...     print("%6s a[%d:%d] b[%d:%d]" % opcode)
     equal a[0:8] b[0:8]
    insert a[8:8] b[8:17]
     equal a[8:29] b[17:38]

    See the Differ class for a fancy human-friendly file differencer, which
    uses SequenceMatcher both to compare sequences of lines, and to compare
    sequences of characters within similar (near-matching) lines.

    See also function get_close_matches() in this module, which shows how
    simple code building on SequenceMatcher can be used to do useful work.

    Timing:  Basic R-O is cubic time worst case and quadratic time expected
    case.  SequenceMatcher is quadratic time for the worst case and has
    expected-case behavior dependent in a complicated way on how many
    elements the sequences have in common; best case time is linear.

    Differ is a class for comparing sequences of lines of text, and
    producing human-readable differences or deltas.  Differ uses
    SequenceMatcher both to compare sequences of lines, and to compare
    sequences of characters within similar (near-matching) lines.

    Each line of a Differ delta begins with a two-letter code:

        '- '    line unique to sequence 1
        '+ '    line unique to sequence 2
        '  '    line common to both sequences
        '? '    line not present in either input sequence

    Lines beginning with '? ' attempt to guide the eye to intraline
    differences, and were not present in either input sequence.  These lines
    can be confusing if the sequences contain tab characters.

    Note that Differ makes no claim to produce a *minimal* diff.  To the
    contrary, minimal diffs are often counter-intuitive, because they synch
    up anywhere possible, sometimes accidental matches 100 pages apart.
    Restricting synch points to contiguous matches preserves some notion of
    locality, at the occasional cost of producing a longer diff.

    Example: Comparing two texts.

    First we set up the texts, sequences of individual single-line strings
    ending with newlines (such sequences can also be obtained from the
    `readlines()` method of file-like objects):

    >>> text1 = '''  1. Beautiful is better than ugly.
    ...   2. Explicit is better than implicit.
    ...   3. Simple is better than complex.
    ...   4. Complex is better than complicated.
    ... '''.splitlines(keepends=True)
    >>> len(text1)
    4
    >>> text1[0][-1]
    '\n'
    >>> text2 = '''  1. Beautiful is better than ugly.
    ...   3.   Simple is better than complex.
    ...   4. Complicated is better than complex.
    ...   5. Flat is better than nested.
    ... '''.splitlines(keepends=True)

    Next we instantiate a Differ object:

    >>> d = Differ()

    Note that when instantiating a Differ object we may pass functions to
    filter out line and character 'junk'.  See Differ.__init__ for details.

    Finally, we compare the two:

    >>> result = list(d.compare(text1, text2))

    'result' is a list of strings, so let's pretty-print it:

    >>> from pprint import pprint as _pprint
    >>> _pprint(result)
    ['    1. Beautiful is better than ugly.\n',
     '-   2. Explicit is better than implicit.\n',
     '-   3. Simple is better than complex.\n',
     '+   3.   Simple is better than complex.\n',
     '?     ++\n',
     '-   4. Complex is better than complicated.\n',
     '?            ^                     ---- ^\n',
     '+   4. Complicated is better than complex.\n',
     '?           ++++ ^                      ^\n',
     '+   5. Flat is better than nested.\n']

    As a single multi-line string it looks like this:

    >>> print(''.join(result), end="")
        1. Beautiful is better than ugly.
    -   2. Explicit is better than implicit.
    -   3. Simple is better than complex.
    +   3.   Simple is better than complex.
    ?     ++

    'b'
        Construct a text differencer, with optional filters.

        The two optional keyword parameters are for filter functions:

        - `linejunk`: A function that should accept a single string argument,
          and return true iff the string is junk. The module-level function
          `IS_LINE_JUNK` may be used to filter out lines without visible
          characters, except for at most one splat ('#').  It is recommended
          to leave linejunk None; the underlying SequenceMatcher class has
          an adaptive notion of "noise" lines that's better than any static
          definition the author has ever been able to craft.

        - `charjunk`: A function that should accept a string of length 1. The
          module-level function `IS_CHARACTER_JUNK` may be used to filter out
          whitespace characters (a blank or tab; **note**: bad idea to include
          newline in this!).  Use of IS_CHARACTER_JUNK is recommended.

        Compare two sequences of lines; generate the resulting delta.

        When replacing one block of lines with another, search the blocks
        for *similar* lines; the best-matching pair (if any) is used as a
        synch point, and intraline difference marking is done on the
        similar pair. Lots of work, but often worth it.

    Compare two sequences of lines; generate the delta as a unified diff.

    Unified diffs are a compact way of showing line changes and a few
    lines of context.  The number of context lines is set by 'n' which
    defaults to three.

    By default, the diff control lines (those with ---, +++, or @@) are
    created with a trailing newline.  This is helpful so that inputs
    created from file.readlines() result in diffs that are suitable for
    file.writelines() since both the inputs and outputs have trailing
    newlines.

    For inputs that do not have trailing newlines, set the lineterm
    argument to "" so that the output will be uniformly newline free.

    The unidiff format normally has a header for filenames and modification
    times.  Any or all of these may be specified using strings for
    'fromfile', 'tofile', 'fromfiledate', and 'tofiledate'.
    The modification times are normally expressed in the ISO 8601 format.

    Example:

    >>> for line in unified_diff('one two three four'.split(),
    ...             'zero one tree four'.split(), 'Original', 'Current',

    Context diffs are a compact way of showing line changes and a few

    Optional keyword parameters `linejunk` and `charjunk` are for filter
    functions, or can be None:

    - linejunk: A function that should accept a single string argument and
      return true iff the string is junk.  The default is None, and is
      recommended; the underlying SequenceMatcher class has an adaptive
      notion of "noise" lines.

    - charjunk: A function that accepts a character (string of length
      1), and returns true iff the character is junk. The default is
      the module-level function IS_CHARACTER_JUNK, which filters out
      whitespace characters (a blank or tab; note: it's a bad idea to

    'b'Returns generator yielding marked up from/to side by side differences.

    Arguments:
    fromlines -- list of text lines to compared to tolines
    tolines -- list of text lines to be compared to fromlines
    context -- number of context lines to display on each side of difference,
               if None, all from/to text lines will be generated.
    linejunk -- passed on to ndiff (see ndiff documentation)
    charjunk -- passed on to ndiff (see ndiff documentation)

    This function returns an iterator which returns a tuple:
    (from line tuple, to line tuple, boolean flag)

    from/to line tuple -- (line num, line text)
        line num -- integer or None (to indicate a context separation)
        line text -- original line text with following markers inserted:
            '\0+' -- marks start of added text
            '\0-' -- marks start of deleted text
            '\0^' -- marks start of changed text
            '\1' -- marks end of added/deleted/changed text

    boolean flag -- None indicates context separation, True indicates
        either "from" or "to" line contains a change, otherwise False.

    This function/iterator was originally developed to generate side by side
    file difference for making HTML pages (see HtmlDiff class for example
    usage).

    Note, this function utilizes the ndiff function to generate the side by
    side difference markup.  Optional ndiff arguments may be passed to this
    function and they in turn will be passed to ndiff.

    'b'(\++|\-+|\^+)'u'(\++|\-+|\^+)'b'Returns line of text with user's change markup and line formatting.

        lines -- list of lines from the ndiff generator to produce a line of
                 text from.  When producing the line of text to return, the
                 lines used are removed from this list.
        format_key -- '+' return first line in list with "add" markup around
                          the entire line.
                      '-' return first line in list with "delete" markup around
                          the entire line.
                      '?' return first line in list with add/delete/change
                          intraline markup (indices obtained from second line)
                      None return first line in list with no markup
        side -- indice into the num_lines list (0=from,1=to)
        num_lines -- from/to current line number.  This is NOT intended to be a
                     passed parameter.  It is present as a keyword argument to
                     maintain memory of the current line numbers between calls
                     of this function.

        'b''u''b'Yields from/to lines of text with a change indication.

        This function is an iterator.  It itself pulls lines from a
        differencing iterator, processes them and yields them.  When it can
        it yields both a "from" and a "to" line, otherwise it will yield one
        or the other.  In addition to yielding the lines of from/to text, a
        boolean flag is yielded to indicate if the text line(s) have
        differences in them.

    </table>'b'For producing HTML side by side comparison with change highlights.

    This class can be used to create an HTML table (or a complete HTML file
    containing the table) showing a side by side, line by line comparison
    of text with inter-line and intra-line change highlights.  The table can
    be generated in either full or contextual difference mode.

    The following methods are provided for HTML generation:

    make_table -- generates HTML for a single side by side table
    make_file -- generates complete HTML file with a single side by side table

    See tools/scripts/diff.py for an example usage of this class.

        Instead of tab characters being replaced by the number of spaces

        the space with tab characters.  This is done so that the difference
        algorithms can identify changes in a file when tabs are replaced by
        spaces and vice versa.  At the end of the HTML generation, the tab
        characters will be replaced with a nonbreakable space.

    is really done within a Distribution instance, which farms the work out
    to the Distutils commands specified on the command line.

    Setup scripts will almost never instantiate Distribution directly,
    unless the 'setup()' function is totally inadequate to their needs.
    However, it is conceivable that a setup script might wish to subclass
    Distribution for some specialized purpose, and then pass the subclass
    to 'setup()' as the 'distclass' keyword argument.  If so, it is
    necessary to respect the expectations that 'setup' has of Distribution.

        There are three possible config files: distutils.cfg in the
        Distutils installation directory (ie. where the top-level
        Distutils __inst__.py file lives), a file in the user's home
        directory named .pydistutils.cfg on Unix and pydistutils.cfg
        on Windows/Mac; and setup.cfg in the current directory.

        The file in the user's home directory can be disabled with the

        'script_args' instance attribute (which defaults to 'sys.argv[1:]'
        -- see 'setup()' in core.py).  This list is first processed for
        "global options" -- options that set attributes of the Distribution
        instance.  Then, it is alternately scanned for Distutils commands
        and options for that command.  Each new command terminates the
        options for the previous command.  The allowed options for a
        command are determined by the 'user_options' attribute of the
        command class -- thus, we have to be able to load command classes
        in order to parse the command line.  Any error in that 'options'
        attribute raises DistutilsGetoptError; any error on the
        command-line raises DistutilsArgError.  If no Distutils commands
        were found on the command line, raises DistutilsArgError.  Return
        true if command-line was successfully parsed and we should carry

        dictionary and return it.  Otherwise we load the command module
        ("distutils.command." + command) and fetch the command class from
        the module.  The loaded class is also stored in 'cmdclass'
        to speed future calls to 'get_command_class()'.

        this means copying elements of a dictionary ('option_dict') to
        attributes of an instance ('command').

        'command_obj' must be a Command instance.  If 'option_dict' is not
        supplied, uses the standard option dictionary for this command
        (from 'self.command_options').
          setting options for '%s' command:    %s = %s (from %s)bool_optsneg_optis_stringerror in %s: command '%s' has no such option '%s'Reinitializes a command to the state it was in when first
        returned by 'get_command_obj()': ie., initialized but not yet
        finalized.  This provides the opportunity to sneak option
        values in programmatically, overriding or supplementing
        user-supplied values from the config files and command line.
        You'll have to re-finalize the command object (by calling
        'finalize_options()' or 'ensure_finalized()') before using it for
        real.

        'command' should be a command name (string) or command object.  If
        'reinit_subcommands' is true, also reinitializes the command's
        sub-commands, as declared by the 'sub_commands' class attribute (if
        it has one).  See the "install" command for an example.  Only
        reinitializes the sub-commands that actually matter, ie. those
        whose test predicates return true.

        Returns the reinitialized command object.
        Run each command that was seen on the setup script command line.
        Uses the list of commands found and cache of command objects
        created by 'get_command_obj()'.
        Do whatever it takes to run a command (including nothing at all,
        if the command has already been run).  Specifically: if we have
        already created and run the command named by 'command', return

    new_optionshelp_tuple# Regex to define acceptable Distutils command names.  This is not *quite*# the same as a Python NAME -- I don't allow leading underscores.  The fact# that they're very similar is no coincidence; the default naming scheme is# to look for a Python module named after the command.# a string containing comma separated values is okay.  It will# be converted to a list by Distribution.finalize_options().# passing a tuple or an iterator perhaps, warn and convert# 'global_options' describes the command-line options that may be# supplied to the setup script prior to any actual commands.# Eg. "./setup.py -n" or "./setup.py --quiet" both take advantage of# these global options.  This list should be kept to a bare minimum,# since every global option is also valid as a command option -- and we# don't want to pollute the commands with too many options that they# have minimal control over.# The fourth entry for verbose means that it can be repeated.# 'common_usage' is a short (2-3 line) string describing the common# usage of the setup script.# options that are not propagated to the commands# negative options are options that exclude other options# Default values for our command-line options# Store the distribution meta-data (name, version, author, and so# forth) in a separate object -- we're getting to have enough# information here (and enough command-line options) that it's# worth it.  Also delegate 'get_XXX()' methods to the 'metadata'# object in a sneaky and underhanded (but efficient!) way.# 'cmdclass' maps command names to class objects, so we# can 1) quickly figure out which class to instantiate when# we need to create a new command object, and 2) have a way# for the setup script to override command classes# 'command_packages' is a list of packages in which commands# are searched for.  The factory for command 'foo' is expected# to be named 'foo' in the module 'foo' in one of the packages# named here.  This list is searched from the left; an error# is raised if no named package provides the command being# searched for.  (Always access using get_command_packages().)# 'script_name' and 'script_args' are usually set to sys.argv[0]# and sys.argv[1:], but they can be overridden when the caller is# not necessarily a setup script run from the command-line.# 'command_options' is where we store command options between# parsing them (from config files, the command-line, etc.) and when# they are actually needed -- ie. when the command in question is# instantiated.  It is a dictionary of dictionaries of 2-tuples:#   command_options = { command_name : { option : (source, value) } }# 'dist_files' is the list of (command, pyversion, file) that# have been created by any dist commands run so far. This is# filled regardless of whether the run is dry or not. pyversion# gives sysconfig.get_python_version() if the dist file is# specific to a Python version, 'any' if it is good for all# Python versions on the target platform, and '' for a source# file. pyversion should not be used to specify minimum or# maximum required Python versions; use the metainfo for that# instead.# These options are really the business of various commands, rather# than of the Distribution itself.  We provide aliases for them in# Distribution as a convenience to the developer.# And now initialize bookkeeping stuff that can't be supplied by# the caller at all.  'command_obj' maps command names to# Command instances -- that's how we enforce that every command# class is a singleton.# 'have_run' maps command names to boolean values; it keeps track# of whether we have actually run a particular command, to make it# cheap to "run" a command whenever we think we might need to -- if# it's already been done, no need for expensive filesystem# operations, we just check the 'have_run' dictionary and carry on.# It's only safe to query 'have_run' for a command class that has# been instantiated -- a false value will be inserted when the# command object is created, and replaced with a true value when# the command is successfully run.  Thus it's probably best to use# '.get()' rather than a straight lookup.# Now we'll use the attrs dictionary (ultimately, keyword args from# the setup script) to possibly override any or all of these# distribution options.# Pull out the set of command options and work on them# specifically.  Note that this order guarantees that aliased# command options will override any supplied redundantly# through the general options dictionary.# Now work on the rest of the attributes.  Any attribute that's# not already defined is invalid!# no-user-cfg is handled before other command line args# because other args override the config files, and this# one is needed before we can load the config files.# If attrs['script_args'] wasn't passed, assume false.# This also make sure we just look at the global options# dump all command option dicts# -- Config file finding/parsing methods ---------------------------# Where to look for the system-wide Distutils config file# Look for the system config file# What to call the per-user config file# And look for the user config file# All platforms support local setup.cfg# Ignore install directory options if we have a venv# Make the ConfigParser forget everything (so we retain# the original filenames that options come from)# If there was a "global" section in the config file, use it# to set Distribution options.# ugh!# -- Command-line parsing methods ----------------------------------# We now have enough information to show the Macintosh dialog# that allows the user to interactively specify the "command line".# We have to parse the command line a bit at a time -- global# options, then the first command, then its options, and so on --# because each command will be handled by a different class, and# the options that are valid for a particular class aren't known# until we have loaded the command class, which doesn't happen# until we know what the command is.# for display options we return immediately# user asked for help (and got it)# Handle the cases of --help as a "global" option, ie.# "setup.py --help" and "setup.py --help command ...".  For the# former, we show global options (--verbose, --dry-run, etc.)# and display-only options (--name, --version, etc.); for the# latter, we omit the display-only options and show help for# each command listed on the command line.# Oops, no commands found -- an end-user error# All is well: return true# late import because of mutual dependence between these modules# Pull the current command from the head of the command line# Dig up the command class that implements this command, so we# 1) know that it's a valid command, and 2) know which options# it takes.# Require that the command class be derived from Command -- want# to be sure that the basic "command" interface is implemented.# Also make sure that the command object provides a list of its# known options.# If the command class has a list of negative alias options,# merge it in with the global negative aliases.# Check for help_options in command class.  They have a different# format (tuple of four) so we need to preprocess them here.# All commands support the global options too, just by adding# in 'global_options'.# Put the options from the command-line into their official# holding pen, the 'command_options' dictionary.# User just wants a list of commands -- we'll print it out and stop# processing now (ie. if they ran "setup --help-commands foo bar",# we ignore "foo bar").# If user supplied any of the "display metadata" options, then# display that metadata in the order in which the user supplied the# metadata options.# Currently this is only used on Mac OS, for the Mac-only GUI# Distutils interface (by Jack Jansen)# -- Command class/object methods ----------------------------------# Set any options that were supplied in config files# or on the command line.

    This is an enhanced version of 'distutils.dist.Distribution' that
    effectively adds the following new optional keyword arguments to 'setup()':

     'install_requires' -- a string or sequence of strings specifying project
        versions that the distribution requires when installed, in the format
        used by 'pkg_resources.require()'.  They will be installed
        automatically when the package is installed.  If you wish to use
        packages that are not available in PyPI, or want to give your users an
        alternate download location, you can add a 'find_links' option to the
        '[easy_install]' section of your project's 'setup.cfg' file, and then
        setuptools will scan the listed web pages for links that satisfy the
        requirements.

     'extras_require' -- a dictionary mapping names of optional "extras" to the
        additional requirement(s) that using those extras incurs. For example,
        this::

            extras_require = dict(reST = ["docutils>=0.3", "reSTedit"])

        indicates that the distribution can optionally provide an extra
        capability called "reST", but it can only be used if docutils and
        reSTedit are installed.  If the user installs your package using
        EasyInstall and requests one of your extras, the corresponding
        additional requirements will be installed if needed.

     'features' **deprecated** -- a dictionary mapping option names to
        'setuptools.Feature'
        objects.  Features are a portion of the distribution that can be
        included or excluded based on user options, inter-feature dependencies,
        and availability on the current system.  Excluded features are omitted
        from all setup commands, including source and binary distributions, so
        you can create multiple distributions from the same source tree.
        Feature names should be valid Python identifiers, except that they may
        contain the '-' (minus) sign.  Features can be included or excluded
        via the command line options '--with-X' and '--without-X', where 'X' is
        the name of the feature.  Whether a feature is included by default, and
        whether you are allowed to control this from the command line, is
        determined by the Feature object.  See the 'Feature' class for more
        information.

     'test_suite' -- the name of a test suite to run for the 'test' command.
        If the user runs 'python setup.py test', the package will be installed,
        and the named test suite will be run.  The format is the same as
        would be used on a 'unittest.py' command line.  That is, it is the
        dotted name of an object to import and call to generate a test suite.

     'package_data' -- a dictionary mapping package names to lists of filenames
        or globs to use to find data files contained in the named packages.
        If the dictionary has filenames or globs listed under '""' (the empty
        string), those names will be searched for in every package, in addition
        to any names for the specific package.  Data files found using these
        names/globs will be installed along with the package, in the same
        location as the package.  Note that globs are allowed to reference
        the contents of non-package subdirectories, as long as you use '/' as
        a path separator.  (Globs are automatically converted to
        platform-specific paths at runtime.)

    In addition to these new keywords, this class also has several new methods
    for manipulating the distribution's contents.  For example, the 'include()'
    and 'exclude()' methods can be thought of as in-place add and subtract
    commands that add or remove packages, modules, extensions, and so on from
    the distribution.  They are used by the feature subsystem to configure the
    distribution for the included and excluded features.

        _parse_config_files
        Adapted from distutils.dist.Distribution.parse_config_files,
        this method provides the same functionality in subtly-improved
        ways.
        setuptools.extern.six.moves.configparser  reading {filename}_try_str
        On Python 2, much of distutils relies on string values being of
        type 'str' (bytes) and not unicode text. If the value can be safely
        encoded to bytes using the default encoding, prefer that.

        Why the default encoding? Because that value can be implicitly
        decoded back to text if needed.

        Ref #1653
        
        Set the options for 'command_obj' from 'option_dict'.  Basically
        this means copying elements of a dictionary ('option_dict') to
        attributes of an instance ('command').

        'command_obj' must be a Command instance.  If 'option_dict' is not
        supplied, uses the standard option dictionary for this command
        (from 'self.command_options').

        For example, 'dist.include(py_modules=["x"])' would add 'x' to
        the distribution's 'py_modules' attribute, if it was not already
        there.

        Currently, this method only supports inclusion for attributes that are
        lists or tuples.  If you need to add support for adding to other
        attributes in this or a subclass, you can add an '_include_X' method,
        where 'X' is the name of the attribute.  The method will be called with
        the value passed to 'include()'.  So, 'dist.include(foo={"bar":"baz"})'
        will try to call 'dist._include_foo({"bar":"baz"})', which can then
        handle whatever special inclusion logic is needed.

        For example, 'dist.exclude(py_modules=["x"])' would remove 'x' from
        the distribution's 'py_modules' attribute.  Excluding packages uses
        the 'exclude_package()' method, so all of the package's contained
        packages, modules, and extensions are also excluded.

        Currently, this method only supports exclusion from attributes that are

        an argument (e.g. '--quiet'), the 'val' is 'None'.

    **deprecated** -- The `Feature` facility was never completely implemented
    or supported, `has reported issues
    <https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/58>`_ and will be removed in
    a future version.

    A subset of the distribution that can be excluded if unneeded/wanted

    Features are created using these keyword arguments:

      'description' -- a short, human readable description of the feature, to
         be used in error messages, and option help messages.

      'standard' -- if true, the feature is included by default if it is
         available on the current system.  Otherwise, the feature is only
         included if requested via a command line '--with-X' option, or if
         another included feature requires it.  The default setting is 'False'.

      'available' -- if true, the feature is available for installation on the
         current system.  The default setting is 'True'.

      'optional' -- if true, the feature's inclusion can be controlled from the
         command line, using the '--with-X' or '--without-X' options.  If
         false, the feature's inclusion status is determined automatically,
         based on 'availabile', 'standard', and whether any other feature
         requires it.  The default setting is 'True'.

      'require_features' -- a string or sequence of strings naming features
         that should also be included if this feature is included.  Defaults to
         empty list.  May also contain 'Require' objects that should be
         added/removed from the distribution.

      'remove' -- a string or list of strings naming packages to be removed
         from the distribution if this feature is *not* included.  If the
         feature *is* included, this argument is ignored.  This argument exists
         to support removing features that "crosscut" a distribution, such as
         defining a 'tests' feature that removes all the 'tests' subpackages
         provided by other features.  The default for this argument is an empty
         list.  (Note: the named package(s) or modules must exist in the base
         distribution when the 'setup()' function is initially called.)

      other keywords -- any other keyword arguments are saved, and passed to
         the distribution's 'include()' and 'exclude()' methods when the
         feature is included or excluded, respectively.  So, for example, you
         could pass 'packages=["a","b"]' to cause packages 'a' and 'b' to be
         added or removed from the distribution as appropriate.

    A feature must include at least one 'requires', 'remove', or other
    keyword argument.  Otherwise, it can't affect the distribution in any way.
    Note also that you can subclass 'Feature' to create your own specialized
    feature types that modify the distribution in other ways when included or
    excluded.  See the docstrings for the various methods here for more detail.
    Aside from the methods, the only feature attributes that distributions look
    at are 'description' and 'optional'.
    Features are deprecated and will be removed in a future version. See https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/65."Features are deprecated and will be removed in a future ""version.

        You may override this in a subclass to perform additional operations on
        the distribution.  Note that this method may be called more than once

        This method is called by the distribution just before it parses its
        command line.  It checks to ensure that the 'remove' attribute, if any,
        contains only valid package/module names that are present in the base
        distribution when 'setup()' is called.  You may override it in a
        subclass to perform any other required validation of the feature
        against a target distribution.

    This is an enhanced version of 'distutils.dist.Distribution' that
    effectively adds the following new optional keyword arguments to 'setup()':

     'install_requires' -- a string or sequence of strings specifying project
        versions that the distribution requires when installed, in the format
        used by 'pkg_resources.require()'.  They will be installed
        automatically when the package is installed.  If you wish to use
        packages that are not available in PyPI, or want to give your users an
        alternate download location, you can add a 'find_links' option to the
        '[easy_install]' section of your project's 'setup.cfg' file, and then
        setuptools will scan the listed web pages for links that satisfy the
        requirements.

     'extras_require' -- a dictionary mapping names of optional "extras" to the
        additional requirement(s) that using those extras incurs. For example,
        this::

            extras_require = dict(reST = ["docutils>=0.3", "reSTedit"])

        indicates that the distribution can optionally provide an extra
        capability called "reST", but it can only be used if docutils and
        reSTedit are installed.  If the user installs your package using
        EasyInstall and requests one of your extras, the corresponding
        additional requirements will be installed if needed.

     'features' **deprecated** -- a dictionary mapping option names to
        'setuptools.Feature'
        objects.  Features are a portion of the distribution that can be
        included or excluded based on user options, inter-feature dependencies,
        and availability on the current system.  Excluded features are omitted
        from all setup commands, including source and binary distributions, so
        you can create multiple distributions from the same source tree.
        Feature names should be valid Python identifiers, except that they may
        contain the '-' (minus) sign.  Features can be included or excluded
        via the command line options '--with-X' and '--without-X', where 'X' is
        the name of the feature.  Whether a feature is included by default, and
        whether you are allowed to control this from the command line, is
        determined by the Feature object.  See the 'Feature' class for more
        information.

     'test_suite' -- the name of a test suite to run for the 'test' command.
        If the user runs 'python setup.py test', the package will be installed,
        and the named test suite will be run.  The format is the same as
        would be used on a 'unittest.py' command line.  That is, it is the
        dotted name of an object to import and call to generate a test suite.

     'package_data' -- a dictionary mapping package names to lists of filenames
        or globs to use to find data files contained in the named packages.
        If the dictionary has filenames or globs listed under '""' (the empty
        string), those names will be searched for in every package, in addition
        to any names for the specific package.  Data files found using these
        names/globs will be installed along with the package, in the same
        location as the package.  Note that globs are allowed to reference
        the contents of non-package subdirectories, as long as you use '/' as
        a path separator.  (Globs are automatically converted to
        platform-specific paths at runtime.)

    In addition to these new keywords, this class also has several new methods
    for manipulating the distribution's contents.  For example, the 'include()'
    and 'exclude()' methods can be thought of as in-place add and subtract
    commands that add or remove packages, modules, extensions, and so on from
    the distribution.  They are used by the feature subsystem to configure the
    distribution for the included and excluded features.

        On Python 2, much of distutils relies on string values being of

        Why the default encoding? Because that value can be implicitly

         command line, using the '--with-X' or '--without-X' options.  If
         false, the feature's inclusion status is determined automatically,
         based on 'availabile', 'standard', and whether any other feature
         requires it.  The default setting is 'True'.

      'require_features' -- a string or sequence of strings naming features
         that should also be included if this feature is included.  Defaults to
         empty list.  May also contain 'Require' objects that should be
         added/removed from the distribution.

      'remove' -- a string or list of strings naming packages to be removed
         from the distribution if this feature is *not* included.  If the
         feature *is* included, this argument is ignored.  This argument exists
         to support removing features that "crosscut" a distribution, such as
         defining a 'tests' feature that removes all the 'tests' subpackages
         provided by other features.  The default for this argument is an empty
         list.  (Note: the named package(s) or modules must exist in the base
         distribution when the 'setup()' function is initially called.)

      other keywords -- any other keyword arguments are saved, and passed to
         the distribution's 'include()' and 'exclude()' methods when the
         feature is included or excluded, respectively.  So, for example, you
         could pass 'packages=["a","b"]' to cause packages 'a' and 'b' to be
         added or removed from the distribution as appropriate.

    A feature must include at least one 'requires', 'remove', or other
    keyword argument.  Otherwise, it can't affect the distribution in any way.
    Note also that you can subclass 'Feature' to create your own specialized
    feature types that modify the distribution in other ways when included or
    excluded.  See the docstrings for the various methods here for more detail.
    Aside from the methods, the only feature attributes that distributions look
    at are 'description' and 'optional'.

    Features are created using these keyword arguments:

      'description' -- a short, human readable description of the feature, to
         be used in error messages, and option help messages.

      'standard' -- if true, the feature is included by default if it is
         available on the current system.  Otherwise, the feature is only
         included if requested via a command line '--with-X' option, or if
         another included feature requires it.  The default setting is 'False'.

      'available' -- if true, the feature is available for installation on the
         current system.  The default setting is 'True'.

      'optional' -- if true, the feature's inclusion can be controlled from the
         command line, using the '--with-X' or '--without-X' options.  If
         false, the feature's inclusion status is determined automatically,

         that should also be included if this feature is included.  Defaults to
         empty list.  May also contain 'Require' objects that should be
         added/removed from the distribution.

      'remove' -- a string or list of strings naming packages to be removed

In simplest use, end each module M to be tested with:

def _test():
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    _test()

Then running the module as a script will cause the examples in the
docstrings to get executed and verified:

python M.py

This won't display anything unless an example fails, in which case the
failing example(s) and the cause(s) of the failure(s) are printed to stdout
(why not stderr? because stderr is a lame hack <0.2 wink>), and the final
line of output is "Test failed.".

Run it with the -v switch instead:

python M.py -v

and a detailed report of all examples tried is printed to stdout, along
with assorted summaries at the end.

You can force verbose mode by passing "verbose=True" to testmod, or prohibit
it by passing "verbose=False".  In either of those cases, sys.argv is not
examined by testmod.

There are a variety of other ways to run doctests, including integration
with the unittest framework, and support for running non-Python text
files containing doctests.  There are also many ways to override parts
of doctest's default behaviors.  See the Library Reference Manual for
details.

    A single doctest example, consisting of source code and expected
    output.  `Example` defines the following attributes:

      - source: A single Python statement, always ending with a newline.
        The constructor adds a newline if needed.

      - want: The expected output from running the source code (either
        from stdout, or a traceback in case of exception).  `want` ends
        with a newline unless it's empty, in which case it's an empty
        string.  The constructor adds a newline if needed.

      - exc_msg: The exception message generated by the example, if
        the example is expected to generate an exception; or `None` if
        it is not expected to generate an exception.  This exception
        message is compared against the return value of
        `traceback.format_exception_only()`.  `exc_msg` ends with a
        newline unless it's `None`.  The constructor adds a newline
        if needed.

      - lineno: The line number within the DocTest string containing
        this Example where the Example begins.  This line number is
        zero-based, with respect to the beginning of the DocTest.

      - indent: The example's indentation in the DocTest string.
        I.e., the number of space characters that precede the
        example's first prompt.

      - options: A dictionary mapping from option flags to True or
        False, which is used to override default options for this
        example.  Any option flags not contained in this dictionary
        are left at their default value (as specified by the
        DocTestRunner's optionflags).  By default, no options are set.
    exc_msg
    A collection of doctest examples that should be run in a single
    namespace.  Each `DocTest` defines the following attributes:

      - examples: the list of examples.

      - globs: The namespace (aka globals) that the examples should
        be run in.

      - name: A name identifying the DocTest (typically, the name of
        the object whose docstring this DocTest was extracted from).

      - filename: The name of the file that this DocTest was extracted
        from, or `None` if the filename is unknown.

      - lineno: The line number within filename where this DocTest
        begins, or `None` if the line number is unavailable.  This
        line number is zero-based, with respect to the beginning of
        the file.

      - docstring: The string that the examples were extracted from,
        or `None` if the string is unavailable.

        Line numbers for the Examples are 0-based.  The optional
        argument `name` is a name identifying this string, and is only
        used for error messages.
        _min_indentmin_indentcharno_parse_exampleget_doctest
        Extract all doctest examples from the given string, and

        `globs`, `name`, `filename`, and `lineno` are attributes for
        the new `DocTest` object.  See the documentation for `DocTest`
        for more information.
        get_examples
        Extract all doctest examples from the given string, and return
        them as a list of `Example` objects.  Line numbers are
        0-based, because it's most common in doctests that nothing
        interesting appears on the same line as opening triple-quote,
        and so the first interesting line is called "line 1" then.

        The optional argument `name` is a name identifying this
        string, and is only used for error messages.
        
        Given a regular expression match from `_EXAMPLE_RE` (`m`),

        and `want` is the example's expected output (with indentation
        stripped).

        `name` is the string's name, and `lineno` is the line number
        where the example starts; both are used for error messages.

        line %r of the docstring for %s has inconsistent leading whitespace: %r'line %r of the docstring for %s has ''inconsistent leading whitespace: %r'
    A class used to extract the DocTests that are relevant to a given
    object, from its docstring and the docstrings of its contained
    objects.  Doctests can currently be extracted from the following
    object types: modules, functions, classes, methods, staticmethods,
    classmethods, and properties.
    recurseexclude_empty
        Create a new doctest finder.

        The optional argument `parser` specifies a class or
        function that should be used to create new DocTest objects (or
        objects that implement the same interface as DocTest).  The
        signature for this factory function should match the signature
        of the DocTest constructor.

        If the optional argument `recurse` is false, then `find` will
        only examine the given object, and not any contained objects.

        If the optional argument `exclude_empty` is false, then `find`
        will include tests for objects with empty docstrings.
        _verbose_recurse_exclude_emptyextraglobs
        Return a list of the DocTests that are defined by the given
        object's docstring, or by any of its contained objects'
        docstrings.

        The optional parameter `module` is the module that contains
        the given object.  If the module is not specified or is None, then
        the test finder will attempt to automatically determine the
        correct module.  The object's module is used:

            - As a default namespace, if `globs` is not specified.
            - To prevent the DocTestFinder from extracting DocTests
              from objects that are imported from other modules.
            - To find the name of the file containing the object.
            - To help find the line number of the object within its
              file.

        Contained objects whose module does not match `module` are ignored.

        If `module` is False, no attempt to find the module will be made.
        This is obscure, of use mostly in tests:  if `module` is False, or
        is None but cannot be found automatically, then all objects are
        considered to belong to the (non-existent) module, so all contained
        objects will (recursively) be searched for doctests.

        The globals for each DocTest is formed by combining `globs`
        and `extraglobs` (bindings in `extraglobs` override bindings
        in `globs`).  A new copy of the globals dictionary is created
        for each DocTest.  If `globs` is not specified, then it
        defaults to the module's `__dict__`, if specified, or {}
        otherwise.  If `extraglobs` is not specified, then it defaults
        to {}.

        otherwise, return None.
        _find_lineno
        Return a line number of the given object's docstring.  Note:
        this method assumes that the object has a docstring.
        ^\s*class\s*%s\bismethodistracebackisframeiscode(^|.*:)\s*\w*("|\')
    A class used to run DocTest test cases, and accumulate statistics.
    The `run` method is used to process a single DocTest case.  It
    returns a tuple `(f, t)`, where `t` is the number of test cases
    tried, and `f` is the number of test cases that failed.

        >>> tests = DocTestFinder().find(_TestClass)
        >>> runner = DocTestRunner(verbose=False)
        >>> tests.sort(key = lambda test: test.name)
        >>> for test in tests:
        ...     print(test.name, '->', runner.run(test))
        _TestClass -> TestResults(failed=0, attempted=2)
        _TestClass.__init__ -> TestResults(failed=0, attempted=2)
        _TestClass.get -> TestResults(failed=0, attempted=2)
        _TestClass.square -> TestResults(failed=0, attempted=1)

    The `summarize` method prints a summary of all the test cases that
    have been run by the runner, and returns an aggregated `(f, t)`
    tuple:

        >>> runner.summarize(verbose=1)
        4 items passed all tests:
           2 tests in _TestClass
           2 tests in _TestClass.__init__
           2 tests in _TestClass.get
           1 tests in _TestClass.square
        7 tests in 4 items.
        7 passed and 0 failed.
        Test passed.
        TestResults(failed=0, attempted=7)

    The aggregated number of tried examples and failed examples is
    also available via the `tries` and `failures` attributes:

        >>> runner.tries
        7
        >>> runner.failures
        0

    The comparison between expected outputs and actual outputs is done
    by an `OutputChecker`.  This comparison may be customized with a
    number of option flags; see the documentation for `testmod` for
    more information.  If the option flags are insufficient, then the
    comparison may also be customized by passing a subclass of
    `OutputChecker` to the constructor.

    The test runner's display output can be controlled in two ways.
    First, an output function (`out) can be passed to
    `TestRunner.run`; this function will be called with strings that
    should be displayed.  It defaults to `sys.stdout.write`.  If
    capturing the output is not sufficient, then the display output
    can be also customized by subclassing DocTestRunner, and
    overriding the methods `report_start`, `report_success`,
    `report_unexpected_exception`, and `report_failure`.
    DIVIDERchecker
        Create a new test runner.

        Optional keyword arg `checker` is the `OutputChecker` that
        should be used to compare the expected outputs and actual
        outputs of doctest examples.

        Optional keyword arg 'verbose' prints lots of stuff if true,
        only failures if false; by default, it's true iff '-v' is in
        sys.argv.

        Optional argument `optionflags` can be used to control how the
        test runner compares expected output to actual output, and how
        it displays failures.  See the documentation for `testmod` for
        more information.

        Run the examples in `test`.  Write the outcome of each example
        with one of the `DocTestRunner.report_*` methods, using the
        writer function `out`.  `compileflags` is the set of compiler
        flags that should be used to execute examples.  Return a tuple
        `(f, t)`, where `t` is the number of examples tried, and `f`
        is the number of examples that failed.  The examples are run

        Run the examples in `test`, and display the results using the
        writer function `out`.

        The examples are run in the namespace `test.globs`.  If
        `clear_globs` is true (the default), then this namespace will
        be cleared after the test runs, to help with garbage
        collection.  If you would like to examine the namespace after
        the test completes, then use `clear_globs=False`.

        `compileflags` gives the set of flags that should be used by
        the Python compiler when running the examples.  If not
        specified, then it will default to the set of future-import
        flags that apply to `globs`.

        The output of each example is checked using
        `DocTestRunner.check_output`, and the results are formatted by
        the `DocTestRunner.report_*` methods.

        the total number of failed examples, and `t` is the total
        number of tried examples.

        The optional `verbose` argument controls how detailed the
        summary is.  If the verbosity is not specified, then the
        DocTestRunner's verbosity is used.

    A class used to check the whether the actual output from a doctest
    example matches the expected output.  `OutputChecker` defines two
    methods: `check_output`, which compares a given pair of outputs,
    and returns true if they match; and `output_difference`, which
    returns a string describing the differences between two outputs.

        always considered to match if they are identical; but
        depending on what option flags the test runner is using,
        several non-exact match types are also possible.  See the

A DocTest example has failed in debugging mode.

    The exception instance has variables:

    - test: the DocTest object being run

    - example: the Example object that failed

    - got: the actual output
    A DocTest example has encountered an unexpected exception

    The exception instance has variables:

    - test: the DocTest object being run

    - example: the Example object that failed

    - exc_info: the exception info
    Run doc tests but raise an exception as soon as there is a failure.

       If an unexpected exception occurs, an UnexpectedException is raised.
       It contains the test, the example, and the original exception:

         >>> runner = DebugRunner(verbose=False)
         >>> test = DocTestParser().get_doctest('>>> raise KeyError\n42',
         ...                                    {}, 'foo', 'foo.py', 0)
         >>> try:
         ...     runner.run(test)
         ... except UnexpectedException as f:
         ...     failure = f

         >>> failure.test is test
         True

         >>> failure.example.want
         '42\n'

         >>> exc_info = failure.exc_info
         >>> raise exc_info[1] # Already has the traceback
         Traceback (most recent call last):
         ...
         KeyError

       We wrap the original exception to give the calling application
       access to the test and example information.

       If the output doesn't match, then a DocTestFailure is raised:

         >>> test = DocTestParser().get_doctest('''
         ...      >>> x = 1
         ...      >>> x
         ...      2
         ...      ''', {}, 'foo', 'foo.py', 0)

         >>> try:
         ...    runner.run(test)
         ... except DocTestFailure as f:
         ...    failure = f

       DocTestFailure objects provide access to the test:

         >>> failure.test is test
         True

       As well as to the example:

         >>> failure.example.want
         '2\n'

       and the actual output:

         >>> failure.got
         '1\n'

       If a failure or error occurs, the globals are left intact:

         >>> del test.globs['__builtins__']
         >>> test.globs
         {'x': 1}

         >>> test = DocTestParser().get_doctest('''
         ...      >>> x = 2
         ...      >>> raise KeyError
         ...      ''', {}, 'foo', 'foo.py', 0)

         >>> runner.run(test)
         Traceback (most recent call last):
         ...
         doctest.UnexpectedException: <DocTest foo from foo.py:0 (2 examples)>

         >>> del test.globs['__builtins__']
         >>> test.globs
         {'x': 2}

       But the globals are cleared if there is no error:

         >>> test = DocTestParser().get_doctest('''
         ...      >>> x = 2
         ...      ''', {}, 'foo', 'foo.py', 0)

         >>> runner.run(test)

    Test examples in docstrings in functions and classes reachable
    from module m (or the current module if m is not supplied), starting
    with m.__doc__.

    Also test examples reachable from dict m.__test__ if it exists and is
    not None.  m.__test__ maps names to functions, classes and strings;
    function and class docstrings are tested even if the name is private;
    strings are tested directly, as if they were docstrings.

    Return (#failures, #tests).

    See help(doctest) for an overview.

    Optional keyword arg "name" gives the name of the module; by default
    use m.__name__.

    Optional keyword arg "globs" gives a dict to be used as the globals
    when executing examples; by default, use m.__dict__.  A copy of this
    dict is actually used for each docstring, so that each docstring's
    examples start with a clean slate.

    Optional keyword arg "extraglobs" gives a dictionary that should be
    merged into the globals that are used to execute examples.  By
    default, no extra globals are used.  This is new in 2.4.

    Optional keyword arg "verbose" prints lots of stuff if true, prints
    only failures if false; by default, it's true iff "-v" is in sys.argv.

    Optional keyword arg "report" prints a summary at the end when true,
    else prints nothing at the end.  In verbose mode, the summary is
    detailed, else very brief (in fact, empty if all tests passed).

    Optional keyword arg "optionflags" or's together module constants,
    and defaults to 0.  This is new in 2.3.  Possible values (see the
    docs for details):

        REPORT_NDIFF
        REPORT_ONLY_FIRST_FAILURE

    Optional keyword arg "raise_on_error" raises an exception on the
    first unexpected exception or failure. This allows failures to be
    post-mortem debugged.

    Advanced tomfoolery:  testmod runs methods of a local instance of
    class doctest.Tester, then merges the results into (or creates)
    global Tester instance doctest.master.  Methods of doctest.master
    can be called directly too, if you want to do something unusual.
    Passing report=0 to testmod is especially useful then, to delay
    displaying a summary.  Invoke doctest.master.summarize(verbose)
    when you're done fiddling.
    testmod: module required; %r
    Test examples in the given file.  Return (#failures, #tests).

    Optional keyword arg "module_relative" specifies how filenames
    should be interpreted:

      - If "module_relative" is True (the default), then "filename"
         specifies a module-relative path.  By default, this path is
         relative to the calling module's directory; but if the
         "package" argument is specified, then it is relative to that
         package.  To ensure os-independence, "filename" should use
         "/" characters to separate path segments, and should not
         be an absolute path (i.e., it may not begin with "/").

      - If "module_relative" is False, then "filename" specifies an
        os-specific path.  The path may be absolute or relative (to
        the current working directory).

    Optional keyword arg "name" gives the name of the test; by default
    use the file's basename.

    Optional keyword argument "package" is a Python package or the
    name of a Python package whose directory should be used as the
    base directory for a module relative filename.  If no package is
    specified, then the calling module's directory is used as the base
    directory for module relative filenames.  It is an error to
    specify "package" if "module_relative" is False.

    Optional keyword arg "globs" gives a dict to be used as the globals
    when executing examples; by default, use {}.  A copy of this dict
    is actually used for each docstring, so that each docstring's
    examples start with a clean slate.

    Optional keyword arg "extraglobs" gives a dictionary that should be
    merged into the globals that are used to execute examples.  By
    default, no extra globals are used.

    Optional keyword arg "verbose" prints lots of stuff if true, prints
    only failures if false; by default, it's true iff "-v" is in sys.argv.

    Optional keyword arg "report" prints a summary at the end when true,
    else prints nothing at the end.  In verbose mode, the summary is
    detailed, else very brief (in fact, empty if all tests passed).

    Optional keyword arg "optionflags" or's together module constants,
    and defaults to 0.  Possible values (see the docs for details):

        REPORT_NDIFF
        REPORT_ONLY_FIRST_FAILURE

    Optional keyword arg "raise_on_error" raises an exception on the
    first unexpected exception or failure. This allows failures to be
    post-mortem debugged.

    Optional keyword arg "parser" specifies a DocTestParser (or
    subclass) that should be used to extract tests from the files.

    Optional keyword arg "encoding" specifies an encoding that should
    be used to convert the file to unicode.

    Advanced tomfoolery:  testmod runs methods of a local instance of
    class doctest.Tester, then merges the results into (or creates)
    global Tester instance doctest.master.  Methods of doctest.master
    can be called directly too, if you want to do something unusual.

    Test examples in the given object's docstring (`f`), using `globs`
    as globals.  Optional argument `name` is used in failure messages.
    If the optional argument `verbose` is true, then generate output
    even if there are no failures.

    `compileflags` gives the set of flags that should be used by the
    Python compiler when running the examples.  If not specified, then
    it will default to the set of future-import flags that apply to
    `globs`.

    Optional keyword arg `optionflags` specifies options for the
    testing and output.  See the documentation for `testmod` for more
    information.
    _unittest_reportflagsSets the unittest option flags.

    The old flag is returned so that a runner could restore the old
    value if it wished to:

      >>> import doctest
      >>> old = doctest._unittest_reportflags
      >>> doctest.set_unittest_reportflags(REPORT_NDIFF |
      ...                          REPORT_ONLY_FIRST_FAILURE) == old

           The unit test framework includes a debug method on test cases
           and test suites to support post-mortem debugging.  The test code
           is run in such a way that errors are not caught.  This way a
           caller can catch the errors and initiate post-mortem debugging.

           The DocTestCase provides a debug method that raises
           UnexpectedException errors if there is an unexpected
           exception:

             >>> test = DocTestParser().get_doctest('>>> raise KeyError\n42',
             ...                {}, 'foo', 'foo.py', 0)
             >>> case = DocTestCase(test)
             >>> try:
             ...     case.debug()
             ... except UnexpectedException as f:
             ...     failure = f

           The UnexpectedException contains the test, the example, and
           the original exception:

             >>> failure.test is test
             True

             >>> failure.example.want
             '42\n'

             >>> exc_info = failure.exc_info
             >>> raise exc_info[1] # Already has the traceback
             Traceback (most recent call last):
             ...
             KeyError

           If the output doesn't match, then a DocTestFailure is raised:

             >>> test = DocTestParser().get_doctest('''
             ...      >>> x = 1
             ...      >>> x
             ...      2
             ...      ''', {}, 'foo', 'foo.py', 0)
             >>> case = DocTestCase(test)

             >>> try:
             ...    case.debug()
             ... except DocTestFailure as f:
             ...    failure = f

           DocTestFailure objects provide access to the test:

             >>> failure.test is test
             True

           As well as to the example:

             >>> failure.example.want
             '2\n'

           and the actual output:

             >>> failure.got
             '1\n'

    Convert doctest tests for a module to a unittest test suite.

    This converts each documentation string in a module that
    contains doctest tests to a unittest test case.  If any of the
    tests in a doc string fail, then the test case fails.  An exception
    is raised showing the name of the file containing the test and a
    (sometimes approximate) line number.

    The `module` argument provides the module to be tested.  The argument
    can be either a module or a module name.

    If no argument is given, the calling module is used.

    A number of options may be provided as keyword arguments:

    setUp
      A set-up function.  This is called before running the
      tests in each file. The setUp function will be passed a DocTest
      object.  The setUp function can access the test globals as the
      globs attribute of the test passed.

    tearDown
      A tear-down function.  This is called after running the
      tests in each file.  The tearDown function will be passed a DocTest
      object.  The tearDown function can access the test globals as the
      globs attribute of the test passed.

    globs
      A dictionary containing initial global variables for the tests.

    optionflags
       A set of doctest option flags expressed as an integer.
    DocFileCaseFailed doctest test for %s
  File "%s", line 0

%sDocFileTestA unittest suite for one or more doctest files.

    The path to each doctest file is given as a string; the
    interpretation of that string depends on the keyword argument
    "module_relative".

    A number of options may be provided as keyword arguments:

    module_relative
      If "module_relative" is True, then the given file paths are
      interpreted as os-independent module-relative paths.  By
      default, these paths are relative to the calling module's
      directory; but if the "package" argument is specified, then
      they are relative to that package.  To ensure os-independence,
      "filename" should use "/" characters to separate path
      segments, and may not be an absolute path (i.e., it may not
      begin with "/").

      If "module_relative" is False, then the given file paths are
      interpreted as os-specific paths.  These paths may be absolute
      or relative (to the current working directory).

    package
      A Python package or the name of a Python package whose directory
      should be used as the base directory for module relative paths.
      If "package" is not specified, then the calling module's
      directory is used as the base directory for module relative
      filenames.  It is an error to specify "package" if
      "module_relative" is False.

    setUp
      A set-up function.  This is called before running the
      tests in each file. The setUp function will be passed a DocTest
      object.  The setUp function can access the test globals as the
      globs attribute of the test passed.

    tearDown
      A tear-down function.  This is called after running the
      tests in each file.  The tearDown function will be passed a DocTest
      object.  The tearDown function can access the test globals as the
      globs attribute of the test passed.

    globs
      A dictionary containing initial global variables for the tests.

    optionflags
      A set of doctest option flags expressed as an integer.

    parser
      A DocTestParser (or subclass) that should be used to extract
      tests from the files.

    encoding
      An encoding that will be used to convert the files to unicode.
    Extract script from text with examples.

       Converts text with examples to a Python script.  Example input is
       converted to regular code.  Example output and all other words
       are converted to comments:

       >>> text = '''

There's no way for the expected output to indicate# that a trailing newline is missing.# Worst-case linear-time ellipsis matching.# Find "the real" strings.# Deal with exact matches possibly needed at one or both ends.# starts with exact match# ends with exact match# Exact end matches required more characters than we have, as in# _ellipsis_match('aa...aa', 'aaa')# For the rest, we only need to find the leftmost non-overlapping# match for each piece.  If there's no overall match that way alone,# there's no overall match period.# w may be '' at times, if there are consecutive ellipses, or# due to an ellipsis at the start or end of `want`.  That's OK.# Search for an empty string succeeds, and doesn't change startpos.# Support for IGNORE_EXCEPTION_DETAIL.# Get rid of everything except the exception name; in particular, drop# the possibly dotted module path (if any) and the exception message (if# any).  We assume that a colon is never part of a dotted name, or of an# exception name.# E.g., given#    "foo.bar.MyError: la di da"# return "MyError"# Or for "abc.def" or "abc.def:\n" return "def".# The exception name must appear on the first line.# retain up to the first colon (if any)# retain just the exception name# do not play signal games in the pdb# still use input() to get user input# Calling set_continue unconditionally would break unit test# coverage reporting, as Bdb.set_continue calls sys.settrace(None).# Redirect stdout to the given stream.# Call Pdb's trace dispatch method.# [XX] Normalize with respect to os.path.pardir?# Normalize the path. On Windows, replace "/" with "\".# Find the base directory for the path.# A normal module/package# An interactive session.# A module w/o __file__ (this includes builtins)# Combine the base directory and the test path.## 2. Example & DocTest## - An "example" is a <source, want> pair, where "source" is a##   fragment of source code, and "want" is the expected output for##   "source."  The Example class also includes information about##   where the example was extracted from.## - A "doctest" is a collection of examples, typically extracted from##   a string (such as an object's docstring).  The DocTest class also##   includes information about where the string was extracted from.# Normalize inputs.# Store properties.# This lets us sort tests by name:## 3. DocTestParser# This regular expression is used to find doctest examples in a# string.  It defines three groups: `source` is the source code# (including leading indentation and prompts); `indent` is the# indentation of the first (PS1) line of the source code; and# `want` is the expected output (including leading indentation).# A regular expression for handling `want` strings that contain# expected exceptions.  It divides `want` into three pieces:#    - the traceback header line (`hdr`)#    - the traceback stack (`stack`)#    - the exception message (`msg`), as generated by#      traceback.format_exception_only()# `msg` may have multiple lines.  We assume/require that the# exception message is the first non-indented line starting with a word# character following the traceback header line.# A callable returning a true value iff its argument is a blank line# or contains a single comment.# If all lines begin with the same indentation, then strip it.# Find all doctest examples in the string:# Add the pre-example text to `output`.# Update lineno (lines before this example)# Extract info from the regexp match.# Create an Example, and add it to the list.# Update lineno (lines inside this example)# Update charno.# Add any remaining post-example text to `output`.# Get the example's indentation level.# Divide source into lines; check that they're properly# indented; and then strip their indentation & prompts.# Divide want into lines; check that it's properly indented; and# then strip the indentation.  Spaces before the last newline should# be preserved, so plain rstrip() isn't good enough.# forget final newline & spaces after it# If `want` contains a traceback message, then extract it.# Extract options from the source.# This regular expression looks for option directives in the# source code of an example.  Option directives are comments# starting with "doctest:".  Warning: this may give false# positives for string-literals that contain the string# "#doctest:".  Eliminating these false positives would require# actually parsing the string; but we limit them by ignoring any# line containing "#doctest:" that is *followed* by a quote mark.# (note: with the current regexp, this will match at most once:)# This regular expression finds the indentation of every non-blank# line in a string.## 4. DocTest Finder# If name was not specified, then extract it from the object.# Find the module that contains the given object (if obj is# a module, then module=obj.).  Note: this may fail, in which# case module will be None.# Read the module's source code.

This was a feature of doctest in Pythons# <= 2.3 that got lost by accident in 2.4.  It was repaired in# 2.4.4 and 2.5.# [XX] no easy way to tell otherwise# [XX] no way not be sure.# If we've already processed this object, then ignore it.# Find a test for this object, and add it to the list of tests.# Look for tests in a module's contained objects.# Recurse to functions & classes.# Look for tests in a module's __test__ dictionary.# Look for tests in a class's contained objects.# Special handling for staticmethod/classmethod.# Recurse to methods, properties, and nested classes.# Extract the object's docstring.  If it doesn't have one,# then return None (no test for this object).# Find the docstring's location in the file.# Don't bother if the docstring is empty.# Return a DocTest for this object.# __file__ can be None for namespace packages.# Find the line number for modules.# Find the line number for classes.# Note: this could be fooled if a class is defined multiple# times in a single file.# Find the line number for functions & methods.# Find the line number where the docstring starts.

Debugging Support# Add the example's source code (strip trailing NL)# Add the expected output:# Add non-example text.# Trim junk on both ends.# Combine the output, and return it.# Add a courtesy newline to prevent exec from choking (see bug #1172785)## 9. Example Usage# Verbose used to be handled by the "inspect argv" magic in DocTestRunner,# but since we are using argparse we are passing it manually now.# It is a module -- insert its dir into sys.path and try to# import it.

In simplest use, end each module M to be tested with:

def _test():
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    _test()

Then running the module as a script will cause the examples in the
docstrings to get executed and verified:

python M.py

This won't display anything unless an example fails, in which case the
failing example(s) and the cause(s) of the failure(s) are printed to stdout
(why not stderr? because stderr is a lame hack <0.2 wink>), and the final
line of output is "Test failed.".

Run it with the -v switch instead:

python M.py -v

and a detailed report of all examples tried is printed to stdout, along
with assorted summaries at the end.

You can force verbose mode by passing "verbose=True" to testmod, or prohibit
it by passing "verbose=False".  In either of those cases, sys.argv is not
examined by testmod.

There are a variety of other ways to run doctests, including integration
with the unittest framework, and support for running non-Python text
files containing doctests.  There are also many ways to override parts
of doctest's default behaviors.  See the Library Reference Manual for
details.

    A single doctest example, consisting of source code and expected
    output.  `Example` defines the following attributes:

      - source: A single Python statement, always ending with a newline.
        The constructor adds a newline if needed.

      - want: The expected output from running the source code (either
        from stdout, or a traceback in case of exception).  `want` ends
        with a newline unless it's empty, in which case it's an empty
        string.  The constructor adds a newline if needed.

      - exc_msg: The exception message generated by the example, if
        the example is expected to generate an exception; or `None` if
        it is not expected to generate an exception.  This exception
        message is compared against the return value of
        `traceback.format_exception_only()`.  `exc_msg` ends with a
        newline unless it's `None`.  The constructor adds a newline
        if needed.

      - lineno: The line number within the DocTest string containing
        this Example where the Example begins.  This line number is
        zero-based, with respect to the beginning of the DocTest.

      - indent: The example's indentation in the DocTest string.
        I.e., the number of space characters that precede the
        example's first prompt.

      - options: A dictionary mapping from option flags to True or
        False, which is used to override default options for this
        example.  Any option flags not contained in this dictionary
        are left at their default value (as specified by the
        DocTestRunner's optionflags).  By default, no options are set.
    'u'
    A single doctest example, consisting of source code and expected
    output.  `Example` defines the following attributes:

      - source: A single Python statement, always ending with a newline.

        with a newline unless it's empty, in which case it's an empty
        string.  The constructor adds a newline if needed.

      - exc_msg: The exception message generated by the example, if
        the example is expected to generate an exception; or `None` if
        it is not expected to generate an exception.  This exception
        message is compared against the return value of
        `traceback.format_exception_only()`.  `exc_msg` ends with a
        newline unless it's `None`.  The constructor adds a newline
        if needed.

      - lineno: The line number within the DocTest string containing
        this Example where the Example begins.  This line number is
        zero-based, with respect to the beginning of the DocTest.

      - indent: The example's indentation in the DocTest string.
        I.e., the number of space characters that precede the
        example's first prompt.

      - options: A dictionary mapping from option flags to True or
        False, which is used to override default options for this
        example.  Any option flags not contained in this dictionary
        are left at their default value (as specified by the
        DocTestRunner's optionflags).  By default, no options are set.
    'b'
    A collection of doctest examples that should be run in a single
    namespace.  Each `DocTest` defines the following attributes:

      - examples: the list of examples.

      - globs: The namespace (aka globals) that the examples should
        be run in.

      - name: A name identifying the DocTest (typically, the name of
        the object whose docstring this DocTest was extracted from).

      - filename: The name of the file that this DocTest was extracted
        from, or `None` if the filename is unknown.

      - lineno: The line number within filename where this DocTest
        begins, or `None` if the line number is unavailable.  This
        line number is zero-based, with respect to the beginning of
        the file.

      - docstring: The string that the examples were extracted from,
        or `None` if the string is unavailable.

        The optional parameter `module` is the module that contains
        the given object.  If the module is not specified or is None, then
        the test finder will attempt to automatically determine the
        correct module.  The object's module is used:

            - As a default namespace, if `globs` is not specified.
            - To prevent the DocTestFinder from extracting DocTests
              from objects that are imported from other modules.
            - To find the name of the file containing the object.
            - To help find the line number of the object within its
              file.

        Contained objects whose module does not match `module` are ignored.

        If `module` is False, no attempt to find the module will be made.
        This is obscure, of use mostly in tests:  if `module` is False, or
        is None but cannot be found automatically, then all objects are
        considered to belong to the (non-existent) module, so all contained
        objects will (recursively) be searched for doctests.

        The globals for each DocTest is formed by combining `globs`
        and `extraglobs` (bindings in `extraglobs` override bindings
        in `globs`).  A new copy of the globals dictionary is created
        for each DocTest.  If `globs` is not specified, then it
        defaults to the module's `__dict__`, if specified, or {}

    The comparison between expected outputs and actual outputs is done
    by an `OutputChecker`.  This comparison may be customized with a
    number of option flags; see the documentation for `testmod` for
    more information.  If the option flags are insufficient, then the
    comparison may also be customized by passing a subclass of
    `OutputChecker` to the constructor.

    The test runner's display output can be controlled in two ways.
    First, an output function (`out) can be passed to
    `TestRunner.run`; this function will be called with strings that
    should be displayed.  It defaults to `sys.stdout.write`.  If
    capturing the output is not sufficient, then the display output
    can be also customized by subclassing DocTestRunner, and
    overriding the methods `report_start`, `report_success`,
    `report_unexpected_exception`, and `report_failure`.
    'u'
    A class used to run DocTest test cases, and accumulate statistics.
    The `run` method is used to process a single DocTest case.  It
    returns a tuple `(f, t)`, where `t` is the number of test cases
    tried, and `f` is the number of test cases that failed.

        >>> tests = DocTestFinder().find(_TestClass)
        >>> runner = DocTestRunner(verbose=False)
        >>> tests.sort(key = lambda test: test.name)
        >>> for test in tests:
        ...     print(test.name, '->', runner.run(test))
        _TestClass -> TestResults(failed=0, attempted=2)
        _TestClass.__init__ -> TestResults(failed=0, attempted=2)
        _TestClass.get -> TestResults(failed=0, attempted=2)
        _TestClass.square -> TestResults(failed=0, attempted=1)

    The `summarize` method prints a summary of all the test cases that
    have been run by the runner, and returns an aggregated `(f, t)`
    tuple:

        >>> runner.summarize(verbose=1)
        4 items passed all tests:
           2 tests in _TestClass

        the current working directory).

    Optional keyword arg "name" gives the name of the test; by default
    use the file's basename.

    Optional keyword argument "package" is a Python package or the
    name of a Python package whose directory should be used as the

           The unit test framework includes a debug method on test cases
           and test suites to support post-mortem debugging.  The test code
           is run in such a way that errors are not caught.  This way a
           caller can catch the errors and initiate post-mortem debugging.

           The DocTestCase provides a debug method that raises
           UnexpectedException errors if there is an unexpected
           exception:

             >>> test = DocTestParser().get_doctest('>>> raise KeyError\n42',

             ... except UnexpectedException as f:
             ...     failure = f

           The UnexpectedException contains the test, the example, and
           the original exception:

             >>> failure.test is test
             True

             >>> failure.example.want
             '42\n'

             Traceback (most recent call last):
             ...
             KeyError

           If the output doesn't match, then a DocTestFailure is raised:

             >>> test = DocTestParser().get_doctest('''
             ...      >>> x = 1

    Convert doctest tests for a module to a unittest test suite.

    This converts each documentation string in a module that
    contains doctest tests to a unittest test case.  If any of the
    tests in a doc string fail, then the test case fails.  An exception
    is raised showing the name of the file containing the test and a
    (sometimes approximate) line number.

    The `module` argument provides the module to be tested.  The argument
    can be either a module or a module name.

    If no argument is given, the calling module is used.

    A number of options may be provided as keyword arguments:

    setUp
      A set-up function.  This is called before running the
      tests in each file. The setUp function will be passed a DocTest
      object.  The setUp function can access the test globals as the
      globs attribute of the test passed.

    tearDown
      A tear-down function.  This is called after running the
      tests in each file.  The tearDown function will be passed a DocTest
      object.  The tearDown function can access the test globals as the
      globs attribute of the test passed.

    globs
      A dictionary containing initial global variables for the tests.

    The path to each doctest file is given as a string; the
    interpretation of that string depends on the keyword argument
    "module_relative".

    A number of options may be provided as keyword arguments:

    module_relative
      If "module_relative" is True, then the given file paths are
      interpreted as os-independent module-relative paths.  By
      default, these paths are relative to the calling module's
      directory; but if the "package" argument is specified, then
      they are relative to that package.  To ensure os-independence,
      "filename" should use "/" characters to separate path
      segments, and may not be an absolute path (i.e., it may not
      begin with "/").

      If "module_relative" is False, then the given file paths are
      interpreted as os-specific paths.  These paths may be absolute
      or relative (to the current working directory).

    package
      A Python package or the name of a Python package whose directory
      should be used as the base directory for module relative paths.
      If "package" is not specified, then the calling module's
      directory is used as the base directory for module relative
      filenames.  It is an error to specify "package" if
      "module_relative" is False.

    setUp
      A set-up function.  This is called before running the
      tests in each file. The setUp function will be passed a DocTest
      object.  The setUp function can access the test globals as the
      globs attribute of the test passed.

    tearDown
      A tear-down function.  This is called after running the
      tests in each file.  The tearDown function will be passed a DocTest
      object.  The tearDown function can access the test globals as the
      globs attribute of the test passed.

      A set of doctest option flags expressed as an integer.

      A DocTestParser (or subclass) that should be used to extract
      tests from the files.

    encoding
      An encoding that will be used to convert the files to unicode.
    'u'A unittest suite for one or more doctest files.

    The path to each doctest file is given as a string; the
    interpretation of that string depends on the keyword argument
    "module_relative".

    A number of options may be provided as keyword arguments:

    module_relative
      If "module_relative" is True, then the given file paths are
      interpreted as os-independent module-relative paths.  By
      default, these paths are relative to the calling module's
      directory; but if the "package" argument is specified, then
      they are relative to that package.  To ensure os-independence,
      "filename" should use "/" characters to separate path
      segments, and may not be an absolute path (i.e., it may not
      begin with "/").

      If "module_relative" is False, then the given file paths are
      interpreted as os-specific paths.  These paths may be absolute
      or relative (to the current working directory).

    package
      A Python package or the name of a Python package whose directory
      should be used as the base directory for module relative paths.
      If "package" is not specified, then the calling module's
      directory is used as the base directory for module relative
      filenames.  It is an error to specify "package" if
      "module_relative" is False.

    setUp
      A set-up function.  This is called before running the
      tests in each file. The setUp function will be passed a DocTest
      object.  The setUp function can access the test globals as the
      globs attribute of the test passed.

    tearDown
      A tear-down function.  This is called after running the
      tests in each file.  The tearDown function will be passed a DocTest
      object.  The tearDown function can access the test globals as the
      globs attribute of the test passed.

    globs
      A dictionary containing initial global variables for the tests.

    optionflags
      A set of doctest option flags expressed as an integer.

    parser
      A DocTestParser (or subclass) that should be used to extract
      tests from the files.

    To extend this to recognize other objects, subclass and implement a
    ``.default()`` method with another method that returns a serializable
    object for ``o`` if possible, otherwise it should call the superclass
    implementation (to raise ``TypeError``).

    Constructor for JSONEncoder, with sensible defaults.

        If skipkeys is false, then it is a TypeError to attempt
        encoding of keys that are not str, int, float or None.  If
        skipkeys is True, such items are simply skipped.

        If ensure_ascii is true, the output is guaranteed to be str
        objects with all incoming non-ASCII characters escaped.  If
        ensure_ascii is false, the output can contain non-ASCII characters.

        If check_circular is true, then lists, dicts, and custom encoded
        objects will be checked for circular references during encoding to
        prevent an infinite recursion (which would cause an OverflowError).
        Otherwise, no such check takes place.

        If allow_nan is true, then NaN, Infinity, and -Infinity will be
        encoded as such.  This behavior is not JSON specification compliant,
        but is consistent with most JavaScript based encoders and decoders.
        Otherwise, it will be a ValueError to encode such floats.

        If sort_keys is true, then the output of dictionaries will be
        sorted by key; this is useful for regression tests to ensure
        that JSON serializations can be compared on a day-to-day basis.

        If indent is a non-negative integer, then JSON array
        elements and object members will be pretty-printed with that
        indent level.  An indent level of 0 will only insert newlines.
        None is the most compact representation.

        If specified, separators should be an (item_separator, key_separator)
        tuple.  The default is (', ', ': ') if *indent* is ``None`` and
        (',', ': ') otherwise.  To get the most compact JSON representation,
        you should specify (',', ':') to eliminate whitespace.

        If specified, default is a function that gets called for objects
        that can't otherwise be serialized.  It should return a JSON encodable
        version of the object or raise a ``TypeError``.

        Implement this method in a subclass such that it returns
        a serializable object for ``o``, or calls the base implementation
        (to raise a ``TypeError``).

        For example, to support arbitrary iterators, you could
        implement default like this::

            def default(self, o):
                try:
                    iterable = iter(o)
                except TypeError:
                    pass
                else:
                    return list(iterable)
                # Let the base class default method raise the TypeError
                return JSONEncoder.default(self, o)

        qualname
        Either returns an existing member, or creates a new enum class.

        This method is used both when an enum class is given a value to match
        to an enumeration member (i.e. Color(3)) and for the functional API
        (i.e. Color = Enum('Color', names='RED GREEN BLUE')).

        When used for the functional API:

        `value` will be the name of the new class.

        `names` should be either a string of white-space/comma delimited names
        (values will start at `start`), or an iterator/mapping of name, value pairs.

        `module` should be set to the module this class is being created in;
        if it is not set, an attempt to find that module will be made, but if
        it fails the class will not be picklable.

        `qualname` should be set to the actual location this class can be found
        at in its module; by default it is set to the global scope.  If this is
        not correct, unpickling will fail in some circumstances.

        `type`, if set, will be mixed in as the first base class.
        _create_unsupported operand type(s) for 'in': '%s' and '%s'%s: cannot delete Enum member.
        Return the enum member matching `name`

        We use __getattr__ instead of descriptors or inserting into the enum
        class' __dict__ in order to support `name` and `value` being both
        properties for enum members (which live in the class' __dict__) and
        enum members themselves.
        
        Returns members in definition order.
        
        Returns a mapping of member name->value.

        This mapping lists all enum members, including aliases. Note that this
        is a read-only view of the internal mapping.
        <enum %r>
        Returns members in reverse definition order.
        
        Block attempts to reassign Enum members.

        A simple assignment to the class namespace only changes one of the
        several possible ways to get an Enum member from the Enum class,
        resulting in an inconsistent Enumeration.
        member_mapCannot reassign members.
        Convenience method to create a new Enum class.

        `names` can be:

        * A string containing member names, separated either with spaces or
          commas.  Values are incremented by 1 from `start`.
        * An iterable of member names.  Values are incremented by 1 from `start`.
        * An iterable of (member name, value) pairs.
        * A mapping of member name -> value pairs.

        Either returns an existing member, or creates a new enum class.

        This method is used both when an enum class is given a value to match
        to an enumeration member (i.e. Color(3)) and for the functional API
        (i.e. Color = Enum('Color', names='RED GREEN BLUE')).

        When used for the functional API:

        `value` will be the name of the new class.

        `names` should be either a string of white-space/comma delimited names
        (values will start at `start`), or an iterator/mapping of name, value pairs.

        `module` should be set to the module this class is being created in;
        if it is not set, an attempt to find that module will be made, but if
        it fails the class will not be picklable.

        `qualname` should be set to the actual location this class can be found
        at in its module; by default it is set to the global scope.  If this is
        not correct, unpickling will fail in some circumstances.

The value of each symbol is the corresponding integer value,

The dictionary errno.errorcode maps numeric codes to symbol names,
e.g., errno.errorcode[2] could be the string 'ENOENT'.

Symbols that are not relevant to the underlying system are not defined.

To map error codes to error messages, use the function os.strerror(),

        A coroutine which creates a TCP server bound to host and port.

        The return value is a Server object which can be used to stop
        the service.

        If host is an empty string or None all interfaces are assumed
        and a list of multiple sockets will be returned (most likely
        one for IPv4 and another one for IPv6). The host parameter can also be
        a sequence (e.g. list) of hosts to bind to.

        family can be set to either AF_INET or AF_INET6 to force the
        socket to use IPv4 or IPv6. If not set it will be determined
        from host (defaults to AF_UNSPEC).

        flags is a bitmask for getaddrinfo().

        sock can optionally be specified in order to use a preexisting
        socket object.

        backlog is the maximum number of queued connections passed to
        listen() (defaults to 100).

        ssl can be set to an SSLContext to enable SSL over the
        accepted connections.

        reuse_address tells the kernel to reuse a local socket in
        TIME_WAIT state, without waiting for its natural timeout to
        expire. If not specified will automatically be set to True on
        UNIX.

        reuse_port tells the kernel to allow this endpoint to be bound to
        the same port as other existing endpoints are bound to, so long as
        they all set this flag when being created. This option is not
        supported on Windows.

        ssl_handshake_timeout is the time in seconds that an SSL server
        will wait for completion of the SSL handshake before aborting the
        connection. Default is 60s.

        start_serving set to True (default) causes the created server
        to start accepting connections immediately.  When set to False,
        the user should await Server.start_serving() or Server.serve_forever()
        to make the server to start accepting connections.

        create_unix_connectioncreate_unix_serverA coroutine which creates a UNIX Domain Socket server.

        The return value is a Server object, which can be used to stop
        the service.

        path is a str, representing a file systsem path to bind the
        server socket to.

        sock can optionally be specified in order to use a preexisting
        socket object.

        backlog is the maximum number of queued connections passed to

        the user should await Server.start_serving() or Server.serve_forever()
        to make the server to start accepting connections.
        A coroutine which creates a datagram endpoint.

        This method will try to establish the endpoint in the background.
        When successful, the coroutine returns a (transport, protocol) pair.

        protocol_factory must be a callable returning a protocol instance.

        socket family AF_INET, socket.AF_INET6 or socket.AF_UNIX depending on
        host (or family if specified), socket type SOCK_DGRAM.

        reuse_address tells the kernel to reuse a local socket in
        TIME_WAIT state, without waiting for its natural timeout to
        expire. If not specified it will automatically be set to True on
        UNIX.

        reuse_port tells the kernel to allow this endpoint to be bound to
        the same port as other existing endpoints are bound to, so long as
        they all set this flag when being created. This option is not
        supported on Windows and some UNIX's. If the
        :py:data:`~socket.SO_REUSEPORT` constant is not defined then this
        capability is unsupported.

        allow_broadcast tells the kernel to allow this endpoint to send
        messages to the broadcast address.

        sock can optionally be specified in order to use a preexisting
        socket object.

        the same port as other existing endpoints are bound to, so long as
        they all set this flag when being created. This option is not
        supported on Windows.

        ssl_handshake_timeout is the time in seconds that an SSL server
        will wait for completion of the SSL handshake before aborting the
        connection. Default is 60s.

        start_serving set to True (default) causes the created server
        to start accepting connections immediately.  When set to False,
        the user should await Server.start_serving() or Server.serve_forever()
        to make the server to start accepting connections.

        immediately.
        'b'A coroutine which creates a UNIX Domain Socket server.

        The return value is a Server object, which can be used to stop
        the service.

        path is a str, representing a file systsem path to bind the
        server socket to.

        sock can optionally be specified in order to use a preexisting
        socket object.

        backlog is the maximum number of queued connections passed to
        listen() (defaults to 100).

        ssl can be set to an SSLContext to enable SSL over the
        accepted connections.
